# Technical Guide: RStudio

This guide covers the technical setup of your RStudio project and best practices for your survey.

### **RStudio & Quarto Setup**

Your entire paper will be a single Quarto (`.qmd`) file.

#### **1. Create Your RStudio Project**

Follow the steps in `github_guide.md` to create your project by "cloning" your GitHub repository. This is the best way to start.

#### **2. Install Necessary R Packages**

You will need packages to analyze and visualize your data. Open the `Console` in RStudio and run this command:

```         
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "rmarkdown", "quarto"))  
```

-   `tidyverse` is a collection of packages, including `ggplot2` (for visualization) and `dplyr` (for data cleaning).

-   `rmarkdown` and `quarto` are needed to render your final document.

#### **3. Create Your `white_paper.qmd` File**

1.  In RStudio, go to `File` \> `New File...` \> `Quarto Document...`.

2.  Give it a title. Select `PDF` as the output format.

3.  Save the file as `white_paper.qmd` in the main directory of your project.

4.  This file will have a **YAML header** (the part at the top between `---`). This header controls your document. It should look like this:

    ```         
    --- title: "Your Title Here" author: "Your Names Here" format: pdf editor: visual bibliography: references.bib ---  
    ```

    -   The `bibliography: references.bib` line is essential for your citations (see `zotero_guide.md`).

#### **4. R Code Chunks**

You will write your R code in "chunks" inside your `.qmd` file.

-   You can insert a chunk by typing `{r}` (three backticks, `{r}`).

-   This is where you will load, clean, analyze, and visualize your data.

-   **To hide code:** Use chunk options. `echo: false` hides the code but shows the output (like a plot).

    -   Example: `{r, echo=false, warning=false}`
