## Overview

Every researcher looks at the world through a theoretical lens — a set of assumptions and frameworks that guide what questions you ask and how you interpret answers. This week introduces theory not as abstract philosophy but as a practical tool for focusing your research.

**Reading:** Chapter 5 — Choosing Your Lens

## Key Concepts

- Theory as a focusing lens, not a straitjacket
- Inductive vs. deductive reasoning
- How theoretical frameworks shape research questions
- Common frameworks in media research (framing, agenda-setting, uses & gratifications, etc.)
- Connecting theory to your specific research interest

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

1. Explain the role of theory in empirical research
2. Distinguish between inductive and deductive approaches
3. Identify at least one theoretical framework relevant to your topic
4. Complete the Archivist Scouting Report for your primary data source

## Assignment: Archivist Report (25 pts)

Using the Archivist Report template (available via `coursepackR`), complete a thorough evaluation of your **primary data source**:

### Archive Identification
- Source name, provider, and access method

### Scope and Parameters
- Date range (earliest and most recent data)
- Content types available (news, transcripts, social media, etc.)

### Feasibility Analysis
- **Research Interest Alignment:** 2–3 sentences on how this source contains material for your topic
- **Technical Feasibility:** Searchability, exportability, and reliability assessment

### Preliminary Search Findings
- Keywords used (with Boolean operators)
- Total results found
- Sample record title

### Rendering

1. Open the template in RStudio
2. Fill in all sections
3. Click **Render** to produce your PDF

## Discussion Questions

1. How does choosing a theoretical lens change what you notice in your data?
2. Why might two researchers studying the same topic arrive at different conclusions based on their theoretical framework?
3. What theory or framework are you considering for your project, and why?
