This guide shows you how to connect Zotero to your RStudio project to create automated **APA 7th Edition** citations and bibliographies. This is essential for a graduate research paper.

## Why Zotero?

Zotero is a free, open-source reference manager that:
- Saves your academic sources with one click
- Automatically formats citations in any style
- Syncs across devices
- Integrates seamlessly with Quarto documents

## Step 1: Install Zotero & Better BibTeX

1. **Install Zotero:** Go to [zotero.org](https://www.zotero.org/) and download the desktop application
2. **Install the Zotero Connector:** Install the browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, or Safari
   - This lets you save sources from Google Scholar with one click
3. **Install Better BibTeX (BBT) Plugin:** This is **essential** for creating stable citation keys
   - Go to [Better BibTeX releases](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/releases)
   - Download the latest `.xpi` file
   - In Zotero, go to `Tools` → `Add-ons` → Install from file

## Step 2: Create Your Zotero Library

1. Open Zotero on your computer
2. Create a folder for your project (e.g., "Research Paper F25")
3. Start saving sources:
   - Use the Zotero Connector from Google Scholar
   - Manually add sources by clicking `New Item`

## Step 3: Export to BibTeX

1. Right-click your project folder in Zotero
2. Select `Export Collection...`
3. Choose **BibTeX** format
4. Save as `references.bib` in your RStudio project root folder

**Tip:** Use Better BibTeX's auto-export feature for live updates:
- Right-click collection → `Automatic Export...` → Select `BibTeX`

## Step 4: Configure Quarto

In your `research_paper.qmd`, add to the YAML header:
```yaml
bibliography: references.bib
csl: apa.csl
```

## Step 5: Cite in Your Document

To cite a source, use the citation key from Zotero:
```
This research shows X [@authorYear].
```

Example:
```
Social media shapes political engagement [@pew2021].
```

Quarto automatically formats it as: (Pew, 2021)

Full citation appears in bibliography at the end.

## Rendering

When you render your document:
```r
quarto render research_paper.qmd --to pdf
```

Quarto automatically:
1. Inserts formatted in-text citations
2. Creates a properly formatted bibliography
3. Applies APA 7th Edition style

## APA Style CSL File

Make sure you have the APA 7th Edition CSL file:
1. Download from [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles)
2. Save as `apa.csl` in your project root

## Tips

- Keep your Zotero library organized with collections
- Use descriptive note fields for page numbers and key quotes
- Export references.bib frequently to stay in sync
- Check citation formatting in your PDF before submitting
