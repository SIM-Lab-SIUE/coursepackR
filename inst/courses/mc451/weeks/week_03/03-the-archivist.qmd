## Overview

This week you become a research archivist — learning to scout, evaluate, and document data sources before committing to a research project. Good research begins with knowing what data exists, where to find it, and whether it can answer your questions.

**Reading:** Chapter 4 — The Archivist

## Key Concepts

- Primary vs. secondary data sources
- Database scouting: scope, feasibility, and access
- Boolean search strategies for academic databases
- Evaluating source reliability and metadata quality
- Documenting your search process for reproducibility

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

1. Identify potential data sources for a media research question
2. Conduct systematic searches using Boolean operators
3. Evaluate a data source's scope, reliability, and exportability
4. Set up your project folder structure in Obsidian

## Assignment: Project Setup (25 pts)

### Part 1: Obsidian Vault Configuration (10 pts)

Set up your research vault following the Liaison Vault structure:

1. Download the Liaison Vault template from the course website
2. Create the folder structure: `MC_Research_Spring26/`
   - `01_Journal/`
   - `02_Reading/`
   - `03_Project/`
   - `04_Data/`
   - `05_Textbook/`
3. Verify the vault opens correctly in Obsidian

**Deliverable:** Screenshot of your organized vault structure.

### Part 2: Database Exploration (10 pts)

Visit **two** potential data sources relevant to your research interests and document:

- The source name and provider
- What types of content are available
- Date range of available data
- Search capabilities (Boolean, filtering, etc.)
- Export options (CSV, PDF, etc.)

### Part 3: Reflection (5 pts)

In 3–4 sentences, explain which data source seems most promising for a semester-long project and why.

## Discussion Questions

1. Why is it important to evaluate a data source *before* starting your research project?
2. What makes a data source "feasible" for a student research project?
3. How do Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) help you refine search results?

## Submission Checklist

- [ ] Obsidian Vault set up with correct folder structure
- [ ] Two data sources explored and documented
- [ ] Reflection paragraph completed
- [ ] Journal entry for Week 3 completed
