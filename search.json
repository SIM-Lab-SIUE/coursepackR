Does platform (Discord, Twitch, in-game) affect behavior?  ## Related Concepts  - **Parasocial interaction**: One-sided emotional connection to content creators - **In-group/out-group dynamics**: Favoring your team/community over rivals - **Social norms**: Unwritten rules that govern behavior  ## Sources to Read  - Check out the [*Gaming Communities* Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_community) - Look for articles on esports toxicity"},{"path":"https://sim-lab-siue.github.io/coursepackR/full_textbook.html","id":"step-4-linking-notes-together","dir":"","previous_headings":"Setting Up Your Publishing Engine > Your First Markdown Document in Obsidian","what":"Step 4: Linking Notes Together","title":"Welcome to From Vibes to Variables","text":"Obsidian’s power lies linking notes.

Background & Significance: Live-streaming platforms like Twitch created new economic models audience donations sustain creators. Understanding drives donations can inform streamer strategies platform design. Existing research parasocial interaction (PSI) suggests visual intimacy strengthens perceived relationships audiences media figures (Horton & Wohl, 1956; Dibble et al., 2016), studies examine PSI live-streaming contexts. Theoretical Framework: Parasocial Interaction Theory predicts audiences form one-sided emotional bonds media figures. Webcam use increases perceived intimacy allowing viewers see streamers’ facial expressions reactions, thus strengthening PSI intensity. Higher PSI predict greater pseudo-reciprocity behaviors, including donations. Hypotheses: H1: Streamers use webcams receive higher average donations per stream streamers without webcams. H2: Viewer-reported PSI intensity mediate relationship webcam use donation behavior. Method: observe 50 Twitch streams (25 webcams, 25 without) across three game genres (FPS, RPG, strategy). stream, record: (1) webcam presence (yes/), (2) total donations received 2-hour session, (3) viewer count, (4) chat activity (messages per minute). also survey 200 viewers across streams using PSI-Process Scale (Schramm & Hartmann, 2008) measure PSI intensity. Data analyzed using independent samples t-tests (H1) mediation analysis (H2). Feasibility: Twitch streams publicly accessible, requiring IRB approval observational data.

Prior research demonstrates judges’ feedback influences audience perception , likely, advancement outcomes (Shelly et al., 2015). However, whether judges’ feedback differs contestant demographic characteristics (gender, race/ethnicity) remains understudied context reality television talent competition. study addresses gap analyzing judge feedback tone relationship contestant advancement. Research Questions: 1. judges provide systematically different feedback (tone) contestants different genders? 2. positive judge feedback predict contestant advancement? 3. feedback patterns consistent across judges, individual judges show different patterns? Methods Data Source Sample: Data collected American Idol Seasons 20-23 (2022-2024). stratified random sample 60 episodes selected across three performance rounds: auditions (n=15), Hollywood week (n=14), live performance shows (n=31). stratification ensured representation across judging contexts, feedback differs elimination-heavy auditions emotionally charged live shows. episode features three judges (Katy Perry, Luke Bryan, Lionel Richie) providing feedback multiple contestants. Judge comments range brief acknowledgment (“Nice!”) detailed critiques lasting 30+ seconds. judge utterances directed specific contestant coded (n=174 judge comments 60-episode sample). Variables: Judge Feedback Tone (Ordinal, 0-3 scale): emotional valence judge’s feedback comment. - 3 = Strongly Positive (compliments ability, predicts success, uses superlatives) - 2 = Mildly Positive (appreciates effort, identifies strengths) - 1 = Neutral/Constructive (provides technical feedback without judgment) - 0 = Negative (expresses criticism, doubt, concern) Contestant Gender (Nominal): Contestant’s gender identity presented introduction identified judges’ pronouns. Categories: Male, Female, Non-Binary. Contestant Race/Ethnicity (Nominal): Race/ethnicity coded contestant introduction statements appearance, including: White, Black, Latinx, Asian, Middle Eastern, Multiracial. Advancement (Binary): Whether contestant progressed next round (Yes=1, =0) based judge decision. Reliability Testing: pilot study two independent coders examined 3 episodes (approximately 40 judge comments). Inter-coder reliability assessed using Krippendorff’s Alpha: Judge Tone (α=.82), Gender (α=.95), Advancement (α=1.00). acceptable levels (>0.70) indicated codebook clarity. codebook finalized applied full sample. Analysis Plan: Descriptive statistics (means, frequencies) summarized sample characteristics. independent samples t-test compared judge tone male female contestants. Chi-Square test examined association feedback tone advancement. one-way ANOVA assessed whether judges differed feedback patterns. Results Descriptive Statistics (n=174 judge comments): Mean judge tone across comments 2.18 (SD=0.79) 0-3 scale, indicating predominantly positive feedback. Contestants advanced rate 65.5% (114/174). Gender distribution: Male (52.3%), Female (31.0%), Non-Binary (6.9%), Unknown (9.8%). Research Question 1: Judge Tone Contestant Gender independent samples t-test examined whether judge tone differed contestant gender (excluding Unknown category, n=157). Female contestants (M=2.12, SD=0.81) received marginally lower tone scores male contestants (M=2.35, SD=0.75), difference marginally non-significant, t(143)=-1.87, p=.063, Cohen’s d=0.29 (small effect). 95% confidence interval difference ranged -0.473 0.013. Research Question 2: Judge Tone Advancement Chi-Square test examined association judge feedback tone contestant advancement. Judge tone recoded binary: Positive (tone ≥ 2) vs. Non-Positive (tone < 2). relationship highly significant, χ²(1)=46.78, p<.001, Cramér’s V=0.49 (large effect). Contestants receiving positive feedback advanced rate 79.6% (82/103), receiving non-positive feedback advanced 28.3% (15/53). Research Question 3: Consistency Across Judges one-way ANOVA tested whether mean judge tone differed among three judges. Judges showed remarkably similar feedback patterns: Katy Perry (M=2.15, SD=0.79), Luke Bryan (M=2.28, SD=0.82), Lionel Richie (M=2.22, SD=0.76). differences statistically significant, F(2,171)=0.67, p=.511, η²=.008 (negligible effect). suggests judges apply consistent standards evaluating contestants. Discussion study examined judge feedback tone relationship contestant demographics advancement American Idol Seasons 20-23. Three key findings emerged. First, found significant differences judge tone contestant gender, though males received slightly higher tone scores females (difference 0.23 points). difference marginally non-significant (p=.063) small effect size (d=0.29), suggests judges may provide marginally warmer feedback male contestants, consistent prior literature documenting gender bias entertainment industries. However, modest effect size marginal significance indicate pattern warrants replication larger samples. Second, positive judge feedback strongly predicted contestant advancement. Contestants receiving positive feedback advanced rate 79.6%, compared 28.3% receiving non-positive feedback. large effect (V=0.49) suggests judge feedback tone powerful signal advancement likelihood, though causality inferred observational study. Third, three judges exhibited similar feedback patterns, suggesting institutional consistency evaluation standards. notable reality television, judges’ idiosyncratic personalities often drive viewer engagement. consistency may reflect producers’ influence judge behavior genuine alignment evaluative criteria. Limitations: study focused recent seasons (2022-2024), limiting generalizability earlier Idol eras different judging panels production approaches. Race/ethnicity coding relied appearance assessment, introducing potential coder bias despite acceptable inter-rater reliability. Additionally, feedback tone measured verbal cues alone, missing non-verbal communication (facial expressions, body language) might convey different messages. Future research incorporate multi-modal analysis expand additional seasons international Idol franchises. Conclusions: judge feedback tone shows marginal differences contestant gender, strongly predicts advancement. consistency across judges suggests evaluation standards transcend individual judge personalities. Future research examine whether audience voting behavior aligns judge feedback investigate mechanisms feedback influences outcomes.","code":""},{"path":"https://sim-lab-siue.github.io/coursepackR/full_textbook.html","id":"deploying-to-github-pages","dir":"","previous_headings":"Real Data: American Idol Research Report Example","what":"Deploying to GitHub Pages","title":"Welcome to From Vibes to Variables","text":"report complete, deploy live website.","code":""},{"path":"https://sim-lab-siue.github.io/coursepackR/full_textbook.html","id":"step-1-render-the-site","dir":"","previous_headings":"Real Data: American Idol Research Report Example > Deploying to GitHub Pages","what":"Step 1: Render the Site","title":"Welcome to From Vibes to Variables","text":"RStudio, click Render run: generates HTML files _site/ directory.","code":"quarto::quarto_render()"},{"path":"https://sim-lab-siue.github.io/coursepackR/full_textbook.html","id":"step-2-commit-and-push","dir":"","previous_headings":"Real Data: American Idol Research Report Example > Deploying to GitHub Pages","what":"Step 2: Commit and Push","title":"Welcome to From Vibes to Variables","text":"","code":"git add . git commit -m \"Final report complete\" git push origin main"},{"path":"https://sim-lab-siue.github.io/coursepackR/full_textbook.html","id":"step-3-enable-github-pages","dir":"","previous_headings":"Real Data: American Idol Research Report Example > Deploying to GitHub Pages","what":"Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages","title":"Welcome to From Vibes to Variables","text":"Go GitHub repo → Settings → Pages. “Source,” select Deploy branch.
