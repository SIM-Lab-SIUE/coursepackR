## Overview

This double-chapter week covers two critical stages: testing your measurement instrument and preparing for data management. Chapter 11 guides you through the pilot test — a small-scale trial run of your codebook to identify problems before full data collection. Chapter 12 introduces data wrangling in R, preparing you for the analytical work ahead.

**Readings:** Chapter 11 — The Pilot Test & Chapter 12 — Wrangling the Chaos

## Key Concepts

- The pilot test as quality assurance
- Inter-coder reliability (Cohen's Kappa, percent agreement)
- Identifying and fixing codebook problems before full collection
- Introduction to R for data management
- Tidy data principles
- Data import, cleaning, and transformation with tidyverse

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

1. Design and conduct a pilot test of your codebook
2. Calculate basic inter-coder reliability
3. Revise your codebook based on pilot test results
4. Import data into R and perform basic data inspection
5. Understand tidy data structure

## Assignment: Codebook & Qualitative Memo (25 pts)

### Part 1: Pilot Test (10 pts)

1. Select **10 units** from your data source
2. Code all 10 units using your finalized codebook
3. Have a classmate (or use a second pass) code the same 10 units
4. Calculate percent agreement for each variable
5. Document any discrepancies and how you resolved them

### Part 2: Revised Codebook (10 pts)

Based on your pilot test results:
- Revise any ambiguous coding categories
- Add or clarify decision rules
- Update examples where needed
- Submit the **final version** of your codebook

### Part 3: Data Wrangling Preview (5 pts)

In RStudio, load the `unified_music` dataset and complete the following:

```r
library(coursepackR)
data(unified_music)

# 1. How many rows and columns?
dim(unified_music)

# 2. What are the variable names?
names(unified_music)

# 3. Show the first few rows
head(unified_music)
```

Write 2–3 sentences describing the structure of the dataset.

## Discussion Questions

1. What did your pilot test reveal about your codebook that you didn't expect?
2. Why is inter-coder reliability important even if you are the only coder?
3. What does it mean for data to be "tidy"?
