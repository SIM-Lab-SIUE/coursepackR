## Overview

Descriptive statistics tell you what happened in your data. Inferential statistics tell you whether it *matters* — whether the patterns you see are likely real or just due to chance. This week introduces the logic of hypothesis testing and the tools for making statistical inferences.

**Reading:** Chapter 14 — The Surprise Detector

## Key Concepts

- The logic of hypothesis testing
- Null and alternative hypotheses
- Statistical significance and p-values
- Type I and Type II errors
- Common tests: chi-square, t-test, correlation
- The difference between statistical and practical significance

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

1. Formulate null and alternative hypotheses
2. Select an appropriate statistical test for your data
3. Conduct basic inferential tests in R
4. Interpret p-values and test statistics
5. Distinguish between statistical significance and practical importance

## Assignment: Data Wrangling in R (25 pts)

### Part 1: Hypothesis Setup (5 pts)

For your research project (or using the `unified_music` dataset):
- State a null hypothesis (H0) and alternative hypothesis (H1)
- Identify the appropriate statistical test and justify your choice
- Identify the variables involved and their levels of measurement

### Part 2: Statistical Analysis in R (15 pts)

Conduct **two** of the following analyses using R:

**Option A: Chi-Square Test** (for two categorical variables)
```r
# Example: Is genre independent of decade?
table_data <- table(unified_music$genre, unified_music$decade)
chisq.test(table_data)
```

**Option B: T-Test** (comparing means of two groups)
```r
# Example: Do two genres differ in danceability?
t.test(danceability ~ genre, data = subset_data)
```

**Option C: Correlation** (relationship between two numeric variables)
```r
# Example: Is there a relationship between tempo and energy?
cor.test(unified_music$tempo, unified_music$energy)
```

For each test, report:
- The test statistic and p-value
- Whether the result is statistically significant (α = .05)
- A plain-language interpretation

### Part 3: Results Write-Up (5 pts)

Write a brief results paragraph in APA style reporting your findings. Include the test statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value, and interpretation.

## Discussion Questions

1. Why can't we "prove" a hypothesis — only fail to reject or reject the null?
2. What does a p-value of .03 actually mean?
3. Why might a statistically significant result not be practically important?

## Submission Checklist

- [ ] Hypotheses stated (null and alternative)
- [ ] Two statistical tests conducted in R
- [ ] Results reported with test statistics and p-values
- [ ] APA-style results paragraph written
- [ ] Quarto document rendered and uploaded
- [ ] Journal entry for Week 13 completed
