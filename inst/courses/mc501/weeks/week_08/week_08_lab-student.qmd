## Week 8: From Concepts to Code

**Textbook Chapter:** 8: The Art of Measurement\
**Dataset:** `ATP_W144_excerpt` (included in the `mccoursepack` package)\
**Core Functions/Packages:** `tidyverse` (for data manipulation and visualization)

### 1. Load the Data


We will use the `ATP_W144_excerpt` dataset to explore the concepts of measurement. Follow these steps:

``` r
# Load the required packages
library(mccoursepack)
library(tidyverse)

# Load the dataset
#> mccoursepack v0.1.0: Pew Research Center ATP W144 excerpt loaded. See ?ATP_W144_excerpt for details.
data(ATP_W144_excerpt)

# Confirm the dataset is loaded
head(ATP_W144_excerpt)
```

### 2. Explore Data Types

Understanding the structure of the dataset is the first step in conceptualizing and operationalizing variables.

``` r
# View the structure of the dataset
glimpse(ATP_W144_excerpt)

# Discuss: Which columns are numeric, character, or factor?
```

### 3. Summarize Numeric Variables

Summarizing numeric variables helps us identify continuous and categorical variables.

``` r
# Get an overview of numeric columns
summary(ATP_W144_excerpt)

# Discuss: Which variables are continuous? Which are categorical?
```

### 4. Convert and Explore Factors

Some variables, like `F_AGECAT` or `F_PARTY_FINAL`, are stored as numeric codes. You may want to treat them as factors to represent categorical data.

``` r
# Convert `F_AGECAT` to a factor (if not already)
ATP_W144_excerpt <- ATP_W144_excerpt %>%
  mutate(F_AGECAT = factor(F_AGECAT))

# Check the structure again
glimpse(ATP_W144_excerpt)

# Discuss: Why might we want to treat `F_AGECAT` as a factor?
```

### 5. Conceptualization and Operationalization


Let’s connect the dataset to the concepts from Chapter 8:

-   **Conceptualization:** Define what we mean by "digital engagement." For example, we might consider internet frequency (`F_INTFREQ`) as an indicator of engagement.
-   **Operationalization:** Use the `F_INTFREQ` column to measure engagement.

``` r
# Example: Summarize internet frequency
ATP_W144_excerpt %>%
  summarize(
    avg_intfreq = mean(F_INTFREQ, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_intfreq = min(F_INTFREQ, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_intfreq = max(F_INTFREQ, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

### 6. Levels of Measurement

Identify the levels of measurement for key variables:

-   **Nominal:** `F_PARTY_FINAL` (political party)
-   **Ordinal:** `F_AGECAT` (ordered age categories)
-   **Interval/Ratio:** `F_INTFREQ` (internet frequency, if treated as numeric)

``` r
# Discuss: Why is `F_AGECAT` ordinal but `F_INTFREQ` is ratio?
```

### 7. Reliability and Validity

Reflect on the reliability and validity of the `F_INTFREQ` variable:

-   **Reliability:** Is the way internet frequency is measured consistent across respondents?
-   **Validity:** Does `F_INTFREQ` accurately measure digital engagement?

``` r
# Discuss: Why is it essential for a measure to be both reliable and valid?
```

### 8. Discussion

-   Why is `F_AGECAT` a factor but `F_INTFREQ` is numeric? How does this relate to measurement levels?
-   Think about a time you were measured or evaluated. Did the measure feel reliable and valid? Why or why not?
