You ran the tests. You got your p-values. Some were significant (p < 0.05), some weren't. Some confidence intervals overlapped, some didn't. The numbers are in front of you.

Now comes the hard part: What do they *mean*?

Statistical software doesn't interpret for you. It won't tell you whether your finding is important, whether it generalizes beyond your sample, or whether there might be alternative explanations you haven't considered. It gives you numbers. You have to turn those numbers into understanding.

This is where research gets messy, and honest. The mechanical part (running tests) is straightforward. The interpretive part (deciding what the results mean) requires judgment, intellectual humility, and the courage to acknowledge when your findings are weaker than you hoped.

This chapter teaches you to interpret results honestly.

## Effect Sizes: How Much Does It Matter?

Chapter 19 taught you that p-values tell you *whether* an effect exists. Effect sizes tell you *how much*.

A statistically significant finding with a tiny effect size might not matter in practice. A non-significant finding with a large effect size might be worth paying attention to (you just didn't have enough data to detect it reliably).

### Cohen's d: Standardized Mean Difference

**Use when**: Comparing means between two groups

**Formula**: d = (Mean₁ - Mean₂) / Pooled SD

**Interpretation** (Cohen, 1988):

- d = 0.2: Small effect
- d = 0.5: Medium effect
- d = 0.8: Large effect

**Example**: Do negative sentiment songs have higher tempo than positive sentiment songs?

```r
library(effsize)

negative_tempo <- music_data %>% 
  filter(Lyric_Sentiment == "Negative") %>% 
  pull(Tempo)

positive_tempo <- music_data %>% 
  filter(Lyric_Sentiment == "Positive") %>% 
  pull(Tempo)

cohen.d(negative_tempo, positive_tempo)
```

**Output**:

```
Cohen's d

d estimate: 0.52 (medium)
95 percent confidence interval:
   lower    upper 
  0.15     0.89
```

**Interpretation**: The difference in tempo between negative and positive songs is medium-sized. Negative songs are about half a standard deviation faster. This is noticeable but not dramatic.

### Pearson's r: Correlation Coefficient

**Use when**: Measuring association between two numeric variables

**Interpretation** (Cohen, 1988):

- |r| = 0.1: Small correlation
- |r| = 0.3: Medium correlation
- |r| = 0.5: Large correlation

**Example**: Relationship between tempo and chart position?

```r
cor.test(music_data$Tempo, music_data$Max_Rank)
```

**Output**: r = -0.135, p = 0.056

**Interpretation**: Weak negative correlation. Faster songs chart slightly higher, but the relationship is small. Only about 1.8% of variance in chart position is explained by tempo (r² = 0.018).

### R²: Variance Explained (Regression)

In Chapter 19, you learned that **R²** from a regression model tells you the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the predictor(s). This is a direct measure of how much your model actually accounts for.

**Interpretation** (Cohen, 1988):

- R² ≈ 0.02: Small effect (2% of variance explained)
- R² ≈ 0.13: Medium effect (13% of variance explained)
- R² ≈ 0.26: Large effect (26% of variance explained)

**Example**: Your regression from Chapter 19 found that tempo explained 1.8% of the variance in chart position (R² = 0.018). This is a small effect. It means that knowing a song's tempo gives you very little ability to predict its chart performance. The remaining 98.2% of chart success is determined by other factors: marketing, artist fame, genre, timing, luck, and countless variables you didn't measure.

**But small R² values are normal in social science.** Complex human behaviors are influenced by many variables simultaneously. No single predictor explains most of the variance. A regression with four or five predictors might explain 15-25% of chart variance, and that would be considered a strong model by social science standards. The expectation of large R² values comes from the natural sciences, where controlled conditions reduce noise. In communication research, modest R² values are the rule, not the exception.

### Eta-Squared (η²): Variance Explained (ANOVA)

**Use when**: Comparing means across multiple groups (ANOVA)

**Interpretation** (Cohen, 1988):

- η² = 0.01: Small effect (1% of variance explained)
- η² = 0.06: Medium effect (6% of variance explained)
- η² = 0.14: Large effect (14% of variance explained)

**Example**: Does sentiment category explain variation in chart performance?

```r
library(car)

# Run ANOVA
model <- aov(Max_Rank ~ Lyric_Sentiment, data = music_data)
summary(model)

# Calculate eta-squared
library(sjstats)
eta_sq(model)
```

**Output**: η² = 0.08 (medium effect)

**Interpretation**: Sentiment category explains about 8% of the variance in chart position. That's a medium effect: meaningful but not dominant. Most variation in chart success is explained by other factors.

### Putting Effect Sizes in Context

Effect size benchmarks (small/medium/large) are guidelines, not rules. Context matters.

**Example 1**: A drug reduces heart attack risk by 2% (small effect size). But given the prevalence of heart disease, this saves thousands of lives. Small effect, huge practical importance.

**Example 2**: A teaching method improves test scores by 15 points (large effect size). But if the test is poorly designed and doesn't measure real learning, who cares? Large effect, questionable importance.

**For your music study**: 

A medium effect (d = 0.52 for tempo differences) means the groups overlap substantially. Many positive songs are faster than many negative songs. Sentiment doesn't *determine* tempo; it shifts the distribution modestly.

This is worth reporting and discussing. But you shouldn't overstate it as "negative songs are fast-paced" when the distributions overlap considerably.

## Statistical Power: Why Non-Significance Might Not Mean No Effect

**Statistical power** is the probability of detecting an effect *if it truly exists*.

Low power means: Even if there's a real effect, you might miss it (Type II error, a false negative).

**Power depends on**:

1. **Sample size**: Larger samples = more power
2. **Effect size**: Larger effects = easier to detect
3. **Alpha level**: Stricter thresholds (p < 0.01) = less power than p < 0.05
4. **Variability**: More noise in data = less power

**Example**: You test whether mixed sentiment songs differ in tempo from neutral songs.

- Sample: 30 mixed songs, 20 neutral songs
- Result: p = 0.12 (not significant)
- Effect size: d = 0.45 (medium)

**Question**: Does this mean there's no difference, or did you just lack power to detect it?

**Power analysis**:

```r
library(pwr)

# What was your power to detect d = 0.45 with these sample sizes?
pwr.t.test(n = 25, d = 0.45, sig.level = 0.05, type = "two.sample")
```

**Output**: Power = 0.31 (31%)

**Interpretation**: You only had a 31% chance of detecting this medium effect with your sample size. The non-significant result might reflect low power, not absence of an effect.

**Takeaway**: Don't conclude "no effect exists" from p > 0.05 if your power was low. Instead: "We found no significant difference, but power was limited. A larger study might detect an effect."

## The "Marginally Significant" Problem (p ≈ 0.06)

You test a hypothesis. Result: p = 0.06.

It's *just barely* above the 0.05 threshold. What do you do?

**Bad approach**: Call it "marginally significant" or "trending toward significance" and interpret it as if it were p = 0.04.

**Why this is dishonest**: p = 0.06 doesn't cross the threshold. If you decided beforehand that p < 0.05 was your criterion, you can't move the goalposts after seeing the data.

**Better approaches**:

**Option 1: Report it as non-significant but note the effect size**

"The difference in tempo between negative and positive songs was not statistically significant, t(87) = 1.93, p = .06, though the effect size was medium (d = 0.52, 95% CI [0.01, 0.96]). Given the medium effect size and the confidence interval that barely includes zero, this relationship warrants further investigation with a larger sample."

**Option 2: Acknowledge uncertainty**

"Results were inconclusive. The p-value (p = .06) fell just above the conventional significance threshold, and the confidence interval for the effect included both near-zero and medium-sized effects. We cannot definitively conclude whether tempo differs by sentiment."

**Option 3: Pre-register your alpha level**

If you decide before analyzing data that you'll use p < 0.10 for exploratory studies, then p = 0.06 counts. But you must decide this *before* seeing results, and report it transparently.

**Don't do**: Cherry-pick which p-values you report, run multiple tests and only mention the significant ones, or keep collecting data until p < 0.05. Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn (2011) demonstrated that these "researcher degrees of freedom," seemingly innocuous analytical choices, can produce statistically significant results from random noise.

## Exploratory vs. Confirmatory Analysis

There are two modes of research, and they require different approaches to interpretation.

### Confirmatory Analysis: Testing Pre-Registered Hypotheses

**When**: You had a specific prediction before collecting data

**Example**: "Based on Uses & Gratifications Theory, we hypothesized that sad songs would have lower tempo than happy songs."

**Interpretation standards**:

- p < 0.05 is meaningful evidence
- You can make stronger claims because the hypothesis came first
- Findings are more credible because they were pre-registered (Chapter 6)

### Exploratory Analysis: Discovering Patterns in Data

**When**: You're exploring data without specific predictions

**Example**: "We examined our music dataset to see if any variables related to chart performance."

**Interpretation standards**:

- p < 0.05 is suggestive but needs replication
- You cannot make strong causal claims
- Findings are hypothesis-generating, not hypothesis-testing

**The problem**: Most research is exploratory but reported as confirmatory. Researchers explore data, find a pattern, then write as if they predicted it all along.

This is called **HARKing** (Hypothesizing After Results are Known). It's dishonest and inflates false positives. As discussed in Chapter 8, the pre-registration practices from Chapter 6 are a structural defense against this problem. Your prospectus documents what you planned to test before you ran the analyses.

**Honest approach**: "This was an exploratory analysis. We found [pattern], which was unexpected. This finding should be treated as preliminary and requires replication."

Ioannidis (2005) argued provocatively that "most published research findings are false," in part because exploratory findings are routinely presented as confirmatory, and because publication bias filters the literature toward positive results. His argument remains debated, but the structural problems he identified are real: small samples, small effects, and researcher flexibility produce a literature that overstates what we actually know.

## Alternative Explanations: The Rival Hypotheses

Your data show a pattern. You have a preferred explanation. But could something else explain it?

**Example finding**: Negative sentiment songs chart higher (better) than positive songs.

**Your interpretation**: Audiences prefer emotional authenticity and intensity, which negative songs often provide.

**Alternative explanations to consider**:

1. **Selection bias**: Maybe record labels promote negative songs more heavily (more marketing dollars = higher chart position). It's not sentiment; it's marketing spend.

2. **Genre confound**: Maybe negative songs are disproportionately hip-hop/rock, and *those genres* chart well for reasons unrelated to sentiment.

3. **Temporal trends**: Maybe negative songs became more common in recent years, and recent songs chart better due to recency bias in your sampling.

4. **Reverse causation**: Maybe songs that chart high receive more critical attention, which leads coders to interpret them as more emotionally complex (negative/mixed).

5. **Third variable**: Maybe tempo is the real driver (fast songs chart well, negative songs tend to be fast), and sentiment is just correlated with tempo.

**How to address alternatives**:

- **Test them empirically**: Control for genre, tempo, year in your analysis. If your regression from Chapter 19 included multiple predictors, you can assess whether sentiment still predicts chart position after accounting for confounds.
- **Acknowledge them**: "While we found X, alternative explanations include Y and Z"
- **Propose follow-up studies**: "Future research should examine whether [alternative] explains this pattern"

**Intellectual honesty requires considering whether your preferred story is the *only* story the data support.**

## Common Interpretation Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Overgeneralizing from Limited Samples

**Example**: Your 200 songs were Billboard Hot 100 hits from 2015-2024, mostly pop/hip-hop.

**Overgeneralization**: "Negative sentiment songs are more commercially successful."

**Problem**: Your sample is successful American pop songs. This doesn't generalize to indie music, non-English music, pre-2015 music, or music that didn't chart at all.

**Honest framing**: "Among Billboard Hot 100 songs from 2015-2024, negative sentiment songs achieved higher chart positions on average."

### Pitfall 2: Causal Language from Correlational Data

**Your data**: Negative songs correlate with higher chart positions (r = -0.23, p = 0.03)

**Overstated**: "Negative sentiment *causes* higher chart success."

**Problem**: Correlation does not equal causation (Chapter 11). You didn't manipulate sentiment experimentally. Maybe another variable causes both.

**Honest framing**: "Negative sentiment was associated with higher chart positions, though we cannot determine causality from correlational data."

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring Non-Significant Results

You tested 10 hypotheses. Two were significant (p < 0.05), eight weren't.

**Dishonest**: Report only the two significant findings.

**Problem**: This is **p-hacking**, selectively reporting results to make findings look stronger (Simmons et al., 2011). If you test 10 things, you'd expect 1 false positive by chance at p < 0.05.

**Honest**: Report all tests, or clearly frame as exploratory: "We tested multiple relationships; some reached significance while others did not. Significant findings should be interpreted cautiously given multiple comparisons."

### Pitfall 4: Treating p = 0.049 and p = 0.051 as Categorically Different

**Reality**: These p-values are nearly identical. One barely crosses the threshold, one barely misses.

**Problem**: Treating significance as binary (yes/no) ignores the continuous nature of evidence.

**Better approach**: Report exact p-values and effect sizes. Discuss findings on a continuum of evidence strength rather than a cliff at p = 0.05.

## Writing the Discussion Section

The discussion is where you interpret findings, acknowledge limitations, and contextualize results.

### Structure

**1. Restate main findings** (briefly)

"Negative sentiment songs achieved significantly higher chart positions than positive sentiment songs (p = .038, Cramér's V = 0.21)."

**2. Interpret in context of theory**

"This aligns with Uses & Gratifications Theory (Katz et al., 1973): listeners may seek negative-sentiment songs for emotional catharsis or validation rather than mood enhancement."

**3. Acknowledge limitations**

"Several limitations should be noted. First, our sample included only Billboard Hot 100 songs, limiting generalizability to non-charting music. Second, sentiment coding relied on lyrics alone, not accounting for musical elements. Third, this was a correlational design; we cannot infer causality."

**4. Consider alternative explanations**

"Alternative explanations include genre confounds (negative songs may cluster in genres that chart well) and marketing differences (labels may promote negative songs differently)."

**5. Suggest future research**

"Future studies should examine whether this relationship holds across genres, time periods, and non-English music. Experimental designs manipulating sentiment while holding musical elements constant could test causality."

**6. Conclude with practical or theoretical implications**

"These findings suggest that commercial success in popular music may be driven less by positive messaging than by emotional intensity and authenticity, supporting mood management theories over simple valence preferences."

### Tone: Confident but Humble

**Too weak**: "We found some suggestive patterns that might possibly indicate..."

**Too strong**: "This study definitively proves that negative sentiment causes chart success."

**Just right**: "Our findings indicate a relationship between negative sentiment and chart performance, though causality cannot be inferred from correlational data. This relationship warrants further investigation."

## The Honesty Checklist

Before finalizing your interpretation, ask:

**1. Did I overstate certainty?**

- Claims stronger than data support?
- Correlation presented as causation?
- Sample limitations ignored?

**2. Did I report selectively?**

- Non-significant results omitted?
- Multiple comparisons unacknowledged?
- Hypotheses invented after seeing data (HARKing)?

**3. Did I consider alternatives?**

- Other explanations for the pattern?
- Confounds tested or acknowledged?
- Third variables discussed?

**4. Are effect sizes contextualized?**

- Statistical significance without practical significance?
- Medium effect presented as small (or vice versa)?
- Overlapping distributions ignored?

**5. Is power addressed for non-significant results?**

- "No effect" vs. "insufficient power to detect effect"?
- Sample size limitations noted?

**If you can answer "no" to #1-2 and "yes" to #3-5, you're interpreting honestly.**

## Practice: Interpretation Skills

### Exercise 20.1: Effect Size Calculation

Using your music dataset:

1. Calculate Cohen's d for tempo differences between top-10 and non-top-10 songs
2. Calculate R² from a regression predicting Max_Rank from energy or valence
3. Interpret both effect sizes using Cohen's (1988) benchmarks and confidence intervals

---

### Exercise 20.2: Power Analysis

You tested whether mixed sentiment songs differ from neutral songs in chart position. Results:

- n_mixed = 25, n_neutral = 18
- p = 0.14 (not significant)
- d = 0.38

1. Calculate power for this test using the `pwr` package
2. Interpret: Is "no significant difference" convincing, or might you have missed an effect due to low power?

---

### Exercise 20.3: Alternative Explanations

You find that high-intensity songs chart better than low-intensity songs (p = 0.02, η² = 0.11).

Your interpretation: "Listeners prefer emotionally intense music."

Generate three alternative explanations that could account for this pattern. For each, describe how you would test it.

---

### Exercise 20.4: Writing a Discussion

Choose one significant finding from your analysis (chi-square, correlation, or regression). Write a brief discussion (250-300 words) that:

- Restates the finding with effect size
- Interprets it theoretically
- Acknowledges at least two limitations
- Considers one alternative explanation
- Proposes one follow-up study
- Concludes with implications

---

## Reflection Questions

1. **The Honesty Dilemma**: You find p = 0.07. You know reviewers/editors prefer p < 0.05. You could collect 10 more songs and retest. Is this acceptable? Where's the line between persistence and p-hacking?

2. **Null Results**: You spent months coding 200 songs. All your tests came back non-significant (p > 0.10). How would you feel? Would you be tempted to keep testing different variables until something worked? How do you publish null results in a system that rewards positive findings?

3. **Overstating Findings**: Researchers face pressure to make findings seem important for publication, funding, media coverage. How do you balance honest interpretation with the need to demonstrate impact? When does "framing" become "exaggeration"?

4. **The Ioannidis Challenge**: Ioannidis (2005) argued that most published research findings are false, due to small samples, small effects, researcher flexibility, and publication bias. If this is even partially true, what does it mean for how you read the literature in your field? Does it change how you interpret your own findings?

## Chapter Summary

This chapter taught honest interpretation beyond mechanical testing:

- **Effect sizes** (Cohen's d, r, R², η²) measure magnitude, complementing p-values (Cohen, 1988)
- **Benchmarks**: d = 0.2/0.5/0.8, r = 0.1/0.3/0.5, R² = 0.02/0.13/0.26, η² = 0.01/0.06/0.14 (small/medium/large)
- **Context matters**: Small effects can be important; large effects can be trivial
- **Statistical power**: Low power means non-significant results are inconclusive, not evidence of no effect
- **Marginally significant (p ≈ 0.06)**: Report as non-significant; note effect size if medium/large
- **Exploratory vs. confirmatory**: Exploratory findings need replication; confirmatory findings are stronger
- **Researcher degrees of freedom** can produce false positives from random data (Simmons et al., 2011)
- **Alternative explanations**: Consider rival hypotheses (confounds, reverse causation, third variables)
- **Common pitfalls**: Overgeneralization, causal language from correlations, selective reporting (p-hacking), binary p-value thinking
- **Discussion structure**: Findings → Theory → Limitations → Alternatives → Future research → Implications
- **Honesty checklist**: Avoid overstating, report completely, consider alternatives, contextualize effects, address power

**Prompt**: These two papers, published six years apart, articulate the structural problems in scientific research that later erupted as the "replication crisis" (Chapter 2). Ioannidis approached the problem mathematically, modeling how base rates, sample sizes, and bias interact to produce false positives. Simmons et al. approached it empirically, demonstrating that ordinary-seeming analytical choices (excluding outliers, adding covariates, choosing when to stop collecting data) can produce statistically significant results from random noise.

1. **Simmons et al.'s demonstration**: The authors showed that using four common "researcher degrees of freedom," they could produce a statistically significant finding that listening to a Beatles song literally makes you younger. Walk through their logic: What were the four degrees of freedom? How did each contribute to the false positive? How does this connect to p-hacking as discussed in this chapter?

2. **Ioannidis's mathematical argument**: Ioannidis argues that the probability a published finding is true depends on (a) the prior probability that the hypothesis is correct, (b) the statistical power of the study, and (c) the significance threshold. Using his framework, explain why a field that tests many unlikely hypotheses with small samples will produce a literature dominated by false positives, even if no individual researcher acts dishonestly.

3. **Solutions**: Both papers propose structural solutions. Simmons et al. recommend six requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers. Ioannidis recommends larger studies, standardized protocols, and replication. Evaluate these recommendations: Which are most practical for a graduate student? Which require institutional change? Which have been adopted since publication?

4. **Apply to your own work**: Audit your analysis for this course. How many "researcher degrees of freedom" did you exercise? (Did you exclude outliers? Choose between tests? Add or remove variables?) Document each decision you made and explain why it was justified or, if it wasn't fully justified, how it could have affected your results. This exercise is not about finding fault but about practicing the transparency these authors advocate.

5. **The tension between exploration and honesty**: Simmons et al. and Ioannidis both argue for pre-registration and confirmatory testing. But much of the most interesting science is exploratory. How do you preserve the value of exploration (discovering unexpected patterns) while preventing the problems these papers identify (presenting exploration as confirmation)? Is there a framework that honors both?
