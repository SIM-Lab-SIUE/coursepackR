This guide provides a detailed, beginner-friendly workflow for connecting RStudio to Git and GitHub. We will use the `usethis` R package to handle most of the complex steps automatically.

### Part 1: One-Time Setup

You only need to do this part once on your computer.

#### Step 1: Install Git on Your Computer

Git is a separate program from R and RStudio. You must install it first.

1.  Go to the official Git website: <https://git-scm.com/downloads>
2.  Download the installer for your operating system (Windows or macOS).
3.  Run the installer, accepting all the default options. You don't need to change anything.

#### Step 2: Configure Git with Your Identity

Open the RStudio **Console** and run the following two lines of code, replacing the example text with your actual GitHub username and email. This is how your commits will be identified.

```r
#| eval: false
install.packages("usethis")
library(usethis)

# Replace with your info
edit_git_config() 
```

This will open a text file. Add the following lines, save the file, and close it.

```
[user]
  name = "Your Name"
  email = "your.email@example.com"
```


#### Step 3: Connect RStudio to GitHub with a Personal Access Token (PAT)

GitHub requires a special password called a Personal Access Token (PAT) to connect with tools like RStudio. The `usethis` package makes this easy.

1.  **Generate the Token:** In the RStudio Console, run this command. It will open a new tab in your web browser, taking you to the "New personal access token" page on GitHub.

    ```r
    #| eval: false
    create_github_token()
    ```

2.  **Configure the Token on GitHub:**
    *   In the "Note" field, give your token a descriptive name, like "RStudio Token".
    *   For "Expiration," it is recommended to set a custom date (e.g., the end of the semester).
    *   Under "Select scopes," check the box next to `repo`. This gives your token permission to access your repositories.
    *   Scroll to the bottom and click **"Generate token"**.

3.  **Copy the Token:** You will now see a new page with your token. It will look something like `ghp_...`. **This is the only time you will ever see this token.** Click the copy icon next to it.

4.  **Save the Token in RStudio:** Go back to RStudio and run the following command in the Console. It will prompt you to paste your token. Paste it and press Enter.

    ```r
    #| eval: false
    install.packages("gitcreds")
    library(gitcreds)
    gitcreds_set()
    ```

You are now fully configured! RStudio can securely talk to your GitHub account.

### Part 2: Creating and Connecting a Project

This is the workflow you will use for each new project (like your course journal).

#### Step 1: Create a New RStudio Project

First, create a new, empty RStudio Project. **Do not initialize it as a Git repository yet.**

1.  In RStudio: **File → New Project → New Directory → New Project**.
2.  Give it a name (e.g., `my-journal-project`) and save it somewhere you can find it.

#### Step 2: Turn the Project into a Git Repository

In the RStudio Console, run this command:

```r
#| eval: false
use_git()
```

This will initialize a Git repository in your project folder. RStudio will ask to restart. Click "Yes." When it reopens, you will see a **Git** tab in the top-right pane.

#### Step 3: Create a GitHub Repository and Connect It

Now, tell `usethis` to create a repository on GitHub and connect your local project to it.

```r
#| eval: false
use_github()
```

This command will:
1.  Ask if you want to commit the files you have. Say "Yes".
2.  Create a new, private repository on your GitHub account with the same name as your RStudio project.
3.  Push your local files to the new GitHub repository.

When it's done, it will open a new browser tab showing you your new repository on GitHub, with your files already in it.

### Part 3: The Daily Workflow (Pull, Stage, Commit, Push)

Now that your project is connected, here is the simple, day-to-day workflow for saving your work.

1.  **Pull:** Before you start working, click the blue **Pull** arrow in the Git pane. This gets the latest changes from GitHub. (This is crucial if you work on multiple computers).
2.  **Do Your Work:** Edit your files, write your journal entries, etc.
3.  **Stage Your Changes:**
    *   Go to the **Git** pane. You will see a list of all the files you've modified.
    *   Check the boxes under the "Staged" column for all the files you want to save.
4.  **Commit Your Changes:**
    *   Click the **Commit** button.
    *   A new window will open. In the "Commit message" box, write a short, descriptive message about what you changed (e.g., "Completed Week 3 journal entry").
    *   Click **Commit**.
5.  **Push to GitHub:**
    *   Click the green **Push** arrow. This sends your committed changes up to your GitHub repository.

That's it! You have successfully saved your work to GitHub.
