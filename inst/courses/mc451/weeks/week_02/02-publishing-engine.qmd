## Overview

This week covers two foundational chapters. Chapter 2 introduces the publishing infrastructure that makes reproducible research possible — R, RStudio, Quarto, and Git. Chapter 3 introduces the Reading Journal Protocol, a structured approach to engaging with scholarly literature that you will use throughout the semester.

**Readings:** Chapter 2 — The Infrastructure of Trust & Chapter 3 — The Reading Journal Protocol

## Key Concepts

- Reproducibility as the backbone of credible research
- Literate programming: weaving code and narrative together
- The R → RStudio → Quarto → Git stack
- Version control as an audit trail for your research
- Active reading strategies for scholarly articles
- The three journal approaches: Connector, Troubleshooter, Critic

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

1. Install and verify R, RStudio, Quarto, and Git on your machine
2. Create and render a basic Quarto document
3. Explain why reproducible tools matter for research credibility
4. Use the Reading Journal Protocol to engage with a scholarly text
5. Understand the Syllabus Contract and course expectations

## Assignment: Software Installation & Syllabus Contract (25 pts)

### Part 1: Software Installation & Verification (10 pts)

Install the following tools in order:

1. **R** (v4.4+): [cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org)
2. **RStudio** (latest): [posit.co/downloads](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
3. **Quarto** (latest): [quarto.org/docs/get-started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
4. **Git**: [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
5. **coursepackR**: Open RStudio and run:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("SIM-Lab-SIUE/coursepackR")
library(coursepackR)
mccourse_check()
```

**Deliverable:** Screenshot of `mccourse_check()` output showing all green checks.

### Part 2: First Quarto Document (10 pts)

Create a new Quarto document (.qmd) in RStudio that includes:

1. A YAML header with your name and today's date
2. An introductory paragraph about what you hope to learn this semester
3. An R code block that loads the coursepackR package and prints the first 6 rows of the `unified_music` dataset
4. A brief written explanation of what the dataset contains

**Deliverable:** Rendered HTML file uploaded to Blackboard.

### Part 3: Syllabus Contract (5 pts)

Download and review the Syllabus Contract from the course website. Sign and return it, confirming you understand:

- Grading policies and late work expectations
- Academic integrity standards
- Course communication protocols

## Discussion Questions

1. What does it mean for research to be *reproducible*? Why can't you just describe your steps in a Word document?
2. How does version control (Git) differ from saving multiple copies of a file (e.g., `paper_v2_final_FINAL.docx`)?
3. Which of the three journal approaches (Connector, Troubleshooter, Critic) appeals to you most, and why?

## Submission Checklist

- [ ] R, RStudio, Quarto, and Git installed
- [ ] `coursepackR` installed and `mccourse_check()` screenshot captured
- [ ] Quarto document created, rendered, and uploaded
- [ ] Syllabus Contract signed and submitted
- [ ] Journal entry for Week 2 completed
