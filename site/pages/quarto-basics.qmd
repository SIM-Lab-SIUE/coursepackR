## What is Quarto?

Quarto is a publishing system for scientific/technical docs. You write a `.qmd` file (Markdown + optional code), and Quarto renders it to **HTML**, **PDF**, Word, slides, websites, and more. By default Quarto renders to **HTML** unless you specify another format. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

---

## Install & verify

- Install Quarto from the official site. Then verify in a terminal:
  ```bash
  quarto check
  quarto --version
````

You should see green checks and a version number. ([Quarto][1])

* PDF requires a TeX engine (e.g., TinyTeX). If you don’t have one:

  ```bash
  quarto install tinytex
  ```

  This installs a minimal LaTeX distribution suitable for PDF rendering. ([Quarto][2])

If something fails, see Quarto’s troubleshooting guide (it includes where to find log files). ([Quarto][3])

---

## Your first document

Make a file `report.qmd`:

```markdown
---
title: "My Report"
format: html   # default is html if omitted
---

# Hello, Quarto

This is **Markdown**. Add text, lists, images, and code blocks.
```

Render to HTML:

```bash
quarto render report.qmd --to html
```

You’ll get `report.html` (plus a `_files` folder for assets).

---

## PDF first (recommended course default)

To make **PDF** the default for a document, set `format: pdf` in the YAML:

```markdown
---
title: "PDF-first example"
format: pdf
---
```

Or, set format-specific options:

```markdown
---
title: "PDF-first with options"
format:
  pdf:
    toc: true
    number-sections: true
  html:
    toc: true
---
```

Here, **PDF is the default** because you explicitly set `format: pdf`; HTML is an additional target. Remember: PDF requires a LaTeX installation (TinyTeX recommended). ([Quarto][2])

Useful PDF references: PDF basics (KOMA classes), PDF options (e.g., `documentclass`, `geometry`, `keep-tex`). ([Quarto][4])

---

## Render from RStudio or VS Code

* **RStudio**: open a `.qmd` and click **Render**; it uses the format(s) in the YAML.
* **VS Code**: install the Quarto extension; use **Quarto: Render** or run `quarto render` in the integrated terminal. Authoring tutorials show render + multi-format examples. ([Quarto][2])

---

## Multiple outputs & links between them

You can render multiple formats in one go by listing them under `format:`. To show links to other formats on the HTML page (e.g., “Download PDF”), use `format-links` in HTML options:

```yaml
format:
  html:
    format-links: [pdf]
  pdf: default
```

See HTML format options for details. ([Quarto][5])

---

## Project basics (so you don’t render the whole repo)

Quarto **projects** let you render a folder of documents with shared settings and control *which* files render:

```yaml
# _quarto.yml (project config)
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: _site
  render:
    - index.qmd
    - pages/**/*.qmd    # whitelist only docs in /pages
```

This prevents Quarto from roaming the entire repository—only the listed paths are rendered. See project options and project overview. ([Quarto][6])

---

## Execution control: cache & freeze

Long-running code? Two strategies:

* **Cache**: store chunk results so they aren’t recomputed every render. (Quarto integrates with **knitr** cache for R and Jupyter cache for Python.) ([Quarto][7])

* **Freeze** (projects): reuse previously rendered results during project renders:

  ```yaml
  execute:
    freeze: auto   # only re-render if source changed
  ```

  Freezing is designed for project-level renders to speed up docs/sites; single-file renders always execute code. ([Quarto][8])

---

## Common options you’ll actually use

* **Table of contents** (both HTML and PDF):

  ```yaml
  toc: true
  ```
* **HTML-specific** niceties (examples: `code-fold`, `toc-expand`, etc.). See the HTML options reference. ([Quarto][5])
* **PDF-specific**: `geometry`, `documentclass`, `keep-tex`, `include-in-header` for LaTeX tweaks. ([Quarto][9])

For YAML syntax tips and where to set options (document vs project), see these guides. ([quarto-tdg.org][10])

---

## Troubleshooting quick hits

* **“No TeX installation detected”** → run `quarto install tinytex`, or install TeX Live/MiKTeX; then re-render. ([Quarto][2])
* **Renders the whole repo** → add `project.render` in your project’s `_quarto.yml` to whitelist files (see Project basics above). ([Quarto][6])
* **Something still fails** → check Quarto logs; the Troubleshooting page lists log locations for each OS. ([Quarto][3])

---

## Where this fits with the package

Our templates are set up with **PDF-first** YAML, and the docs website itself is a Quarto **project** that deliberately renders only the pages in `site/`. That keeps student work clean and predictable while giving you a consistent render experience across HTML and PDF. ([Quarto][6])
