## Overview

With your data collected and cleaned, it's time to see what's there. This week introduces descriptive statistics and data visualization — the tools that let you summarize, explore, and communicate patterns in your data before formal hypothesis testing.

**Reading:** Chapter 13 — Seeing Patterns

## Key Concepts

- Descriptive vs. inferential statistics
- Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
- Measures of spread (range, standard deviation, variance)
- Frequency distributions and cross-tabulations
- Data visualization principles (bar charts, histograms, scatter plots)
- Telling a story with descriptive statistics

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

1. Calculate and interpret basic descriptive statistics
2. Create frequency tables and cross-tabulations
3. Build visualizations in R using ggplot2
4. Describe your data's distribution and key characteristics
5. Write a descriptive results paragraph

## Assignment: Sampling Plan / Pilot Report (25 pts)

### Part 1: Descriptive Statistics (10 pts)

Using the `unified_music` dataset (or your own project data), calculate:

```r
library(coursepackR)
data(unified_music)

# Central tendency and spread for a numeric variable
summary(unified_music$danceability)
sd(unified_music$danceability, na.rm = TRUE)

# Frequency table for a categorical variable
table(unified_music$genre)
```

Report the following for **2 numeric variables** and **1 categorical variable**:
- Mean, median, standard deviation (numeric)
- Frequency counts and percentages (categorical)

### Part 2: Visualization (10 pts)

Create **3 visualizations** using ggplot2:

1. A histogram or density plot of a numeric variable
2. A bar chart of a categorical variable
3. A scatter plot or box plot showing the relationship between two variables

Each visualization should have:
- Clear title and axis labels
- Appropriate color or theme
- A 1–2 sentence interpretation

### Part 3: Written Summary (5 pts)

Write a 1-paragraph descriptive summary of your findings. What patterns emerge? What is typical vs. unusual in the data?

## Discussion Questions

1. Why do researchers report both central tendency and spread?
2. When is a median more appropriate than a mean?
3. How can a visualization reveal something that a table of numbers cannot?

## Submission Checklist

- [ ] Descriptive statistics calculated for 3 variables
- [ ] 3 visualizations created with interpretations
- [ ] Written summary paragraph completed
- [ ] Quarto document rendered and uploaded
- [ ] Journal entry for Week 11 completed
