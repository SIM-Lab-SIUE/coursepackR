This guide provides best practices for writing your white paper as a team using Quarto.

## Before You Start

- **Review the assignment:** See [Undergraduate White Paper Overview](undergrad-white-paper-overview.html)
- **Understand white paper style:** Professional, journalistic writing (not academic APA)
- **Set up your environment:** See [Undergraduate Technical Guide](undergrad-technical-guide.html)
- **Plan your team roles:** Who writes intro, methods, analysis, discussion?

## Paper Structure

### 1. Title & Abstract

**Title:** Clear, compelling, descriptive
- Example: "How Social Media Shapes Political Engagement Among Young Adults"

**Abstract:** 100-150 word summary
- What is the issue?
- What did you research?
- Key findings?

```markdown
# How Social Media Shapes Political Engagement Among Young Adults

## Abstract

[100-150 word summary of your research]
```

### 2. Introduction (800-1,000 words)

Hook your reader:
- Start with a compelling fact or question
- Explain the issue's importance
- Preview what you'll cover
- State your research questions

### 3. Literature Review (600-800 words)

Show what's known:
- Summarize existing research
- Highlight gaps or debates
- Lead to your research questions

### 4. Methods (400-600 words)

Explain your approach:
- **What you studied:** Your research topic/questions
- **Who you surveyed:** Sample size, demographics
- **How you collected data:** Survey platform, timeframe
- **How you analyzed data:** What statistics/visualizations you created

### 5. Results (400-600 words)

Present your findings:
- Use clear data visualizations (tables, charts)
- Highlight key numbers
- Include at least **two figures or tables**
- Explain what the data shows (in plain language, not jargon)

### 6. Discussion (600-800 words)

Interpret your results:
- What do your findings mean?
- How do they fit with prior research?
- What are the limitations?
- What are the practical implications?
- What questions remain?

### 7. References

List all sources cited:
```markdown
## References

[Your bibliography, alphabetically sorted]
```

## Writing Style for White Papers

### Keep It Accessible
- Use plain language (explain jargon when necessary)
- Avoid overly academic tone
- Write for a general, educated audience

### Use Active Voice
- ❌ "It was found that..."
- ✅ "Our survey found that..."

### Tell a Story
- Don't just list findings
- Explain what they mean
- Help readers understand the "so what?"

### Be Concise
- Cut unnecessary words
- Get to the point
- Use clear subheadings

### Cite Your Sources
```markdown
Research shows X [@smith2023].
```

## Team Collaboration Tips

### Divide and Conquer
- **Person A:** Introduction & Literature Review
- **Person B:** Methods & Results
- **Person C:** Discussion & References
- **All together:** Proofread and polish

### Consistency
- Use same citation style throughout
- Match heading levels and formatting
- Ensure consistent terminology

### Integration
- Each person should read others' sections
- Smooth transitions between sections
- Unified voice and message

## Creating Visualizations in R

Include at least **two figures or tables:**

```r
# Example: Bar plot
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data, aes(x = category, y = value)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Your Title", x = "X Label", y = "Y Label")
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ No citations
- ❌ Inconsistent formatting
- ❌ Unclear tables/figures
- ❌ Jargon without explanation
- ❌ Unsupported claims
- ❌ Poor grammar/spelling

## Checklist Before Submission

- ✓ Title is clear and descriptive
- ✓ Abstract summarizes key points (100-150 words)

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with an outline** – map out your sections first
