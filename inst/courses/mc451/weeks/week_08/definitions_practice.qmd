## Assignment Description

The purpose of this assignment is to practice differentiating between **conceptual** and **operational** definitions. A **conceptual definition** explains what a concept *means* in abstract or theoretical terms (think "dictionary definition"). An **operational definition** specifies exactly how a concept will be *measured* or manipulated in a particular study.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Instructions

1.  Identify **four variables** that could be used in a research project you are interested in.
2.  For each variable, write a clear **conceptual definition**.
3.  For each variable, write a specific **operational definition**. Remember, this definition must be measurable.
4.  Complete the table below. An example has been provided in italics to guide you.
