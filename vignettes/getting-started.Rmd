## Weekly Workflow

Each week, download the assignment template and work through it:

```r
library(coursepackR)

# See what's available
list_weeks("mc451")

# Download this week's materials
download_week("mc451", 1)

# Open the folder
open_week(1)
```

## The Music Dataset

The package includes a curated dataset of 1,792 songs with Billboard chart
data, Spotify audio features, and metadata:

```r
data(unified_music)
head(unified_music)
```

Key variables include `Max_Rank`, `danceability`, `energy`, `valence`,
`tempo`, and `playlist_genre`.

## Journal Scaffold

Download the reflective journal template:

```r
download_journal("mc451")
```

## Final Project

When you're ready to start the final project:

```r
final_project("mc451")
```

This creates a project folder with a Quarto document, bibliography file,
data directory, and RStudio project file.

## Reading the Textbook

Chapters are available online at
<https://sim-lab-siue.github.io/vibes-to-variables/> and also bundled
with the package for offline access:

```r
# Path to a specific chapter
system.file("textbook", "chapter01.md", package = "coursepackR")
```
