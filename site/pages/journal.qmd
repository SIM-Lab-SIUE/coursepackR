Perfect — here’s a cleaned-up version of the documentation written **only for students**. I’ve removed the maintainer/CSV material and kept the workflow very step-by-step, with clear points where images should go.

Your **course journal** is a Quarto **book**. Each **week** has its own **chapter** with **three prompts**—you answer **one**.  
Word ranges are enforced during render:

- **MC 451:** **250–300** words  
- **MC 501:** **450–500** words

---

## Step 1. Create a new RStudio Project

1. Open RStudio.
2. Go to **File → New Project → New Directory → New Project**.
3. Pick a folder location (for example: `Documents/MC451/`).
4. Give the project a name (for example: `journal_project`).

## Step 2. Install and load the course package

In the **Console**, run:

```r
pak::pak("SIM-Lab-SIUE/mccoursepack")
library(mccoursepack)
````

👉 *Image: Console showing successful installation and `library(mccoursepack)` loaded.*

## Step 3. Download your starter journal

Run:

```r
download_journal("mc451", dest = ".")   # or "mc501"
```

This creates a folder called `journal/` with everything you need.

Inside you’ll see:

```
journal/
  _quarto.yml
  index.qmd
  entry_template.qmd
  entries/
  scripts/
    new_journal_entry.R
    update_chapters.R
  prompts_mc451.csv   # or prompts_mc501.csv
  assets/
```

👉 *Image: RStudio Files pane showing the new `journal/` directory.*

## Step 4. Add a new week chapter

From inside the `journal/` folder, run:

```r
source("scripts/new_journal_entry.R")
```

You’ll be asked for a **week number** (2–14).

The script will:

1. Create a new file in `entries/` (for example: `week_02.qmd`).
2. Add the **three prompts for that week**.
3. Set the correct word range for your course.
4. Update the table of contents so your chapter shows in the book.

👉 *Image: Console showing the script prompting for a week number.*

---

## Step 5. Write your response

1. Open the new file (e.g., `entries/week_02.qmd`).
2. Scroll to the **Response** section.
3. Choose **one** of the three prompts and delete the other two.
4. Write your answer in that section.

Stay in range:

* MC 451: 250–300 words
* MC 501: 450–500 words

👉 *Image: RStudio editor with the “Response” section highlighted.*

---

## Step 6. Render your journal

From inside the `journal/` folder, run:

```bash
quarto render
```

This builds your journal into the folder `journal/_book/`.

You’ll get:

* An HTML version (always)
* A PDF/EPUB version if TinyTeX is installed

If PDF doesn’t work, run:

```r
quarto install tinytex
```

(or just rerun `mccourse_setup()` in R).

## Step 7. Submit your work to GitHub

When you add a new entry, **two files change**:

1. `journal/entries/week_XX.qmd`
2. `journal/_quarto.yml`

In RStudio:

1. Open the **Git pane**.
2. **Stage** both changed files.
3. Write a **commit message** (e.g., “Week 2 journal entry”).
4. **Push** to GitHub.

👉 *Image: RStudio Git pane with files staged and commit message typed in.*

If you forget `_quarto.yml`, your new chapter won’t appear when viewed elsewhere.

## FAQ

**Do I answer all three prompts?**
No—choose **one** prompt each week. Delete the others.

**My word count says “Out of range.”**
Revise until you are inside the required range.

**My new week doesn’t show in the book.**
Make sure you committed and pushed both `week_XX.qmd` **and** `_quarto.yml`.

**Can I go back and revise later?**
Yes—just open the file again, edit, and commit the changes.

---

## Summary

* Your journal is a **Quarto book** inside `journal/`.
* Each week = one chapter with three prompts → you answer **one**.
* Word range is checked when you render.
* Always commit and push **both** your new entry and `_quarto.yml`.
