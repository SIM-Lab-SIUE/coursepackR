title: "Troubleshooting"

This page is a grab-bag of quick fixes and diagnostic commands for the tools used in this course.

## Quarto isn’t found / Render button doesn’t work for `.qmd`

**Symptoms:** RStudio can’t render `.qmd`, or Terminal says `quarto: command not found`.

**Fix:**
1. Install Quarto from the official site, then restart RStudio.
2. Verify from a terminal:
   ```bash
   quarto check
   quarto --version
````

If those commands work, Quarto is installed correctly. ([docs.posit.co][1], [quarto-tdg.org][2])

---

## PDF render fails (“No TeX installation detected”, missing LaTeX package)

**Fix (fastest path):**

1. Let Quarto install TinyTeX (a lightweight LaTeX) for you:

   ```bash
   quarto install tinytex
   ```
2. Verify from R (optional):

   ```r
   if (requireNamespace("tinytex", quietly = TRUE)) tinytex::is_tinytex()
   ```

   Quarto needs a TeX engine for PDFs; TinyTeX satisfies this and is easy to install/update. ([Quarto][3], [Rdrr.io][4])

**If it still fails:** Open the Quarto Troubleshooting page and follow the PDF/LaTeX guidance there. ([Quarto][5])

---

## Quarto tries to render the whole repo

**Symptom:** `quarto preview`/`render` picks up files outside the docs site.

**Fix:** Limit rendering to the website files with a `project.render` whitelist in your website’s `_quarto.yml`:

```yaml
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: _site
  render:
    - index.qmd
    - pages/**/*.qmd
```

This tells Quarto to render only those files (not everything in the repository). ([Quarto][6])

---

## “Files didn’t appear” after running package commands

**Symptom:** You ran a function (e.g., copying template files) but don’t see new files.

**Fixes to try:**

* Confirm you’re inside your course **Project** and check the working directory:

  ```r
  getwd()
  ```
* Refresh the **Files** pane or click into the expected subfolder.
* Re-run the command and watch for messages/errors.

Working within an RStudio **Project** keeps paths consistent and avoids `setwd()` pitfalls. ([MartinCTC][7])

---

## RStudio doesn’t show the **Git** tab

**Fix:** Enable Git for the Project.

* **Tools → Project Options → Git/SVN** → set **Version control system: Git** (or create the Project from **Version Control**).
* Global setting: **Tools → Global Options → Git/SVN** to confirm the Git executable is detected. ([docs.posit.co][1])

**Verify Git is on your PATH:**

```bash
git --version
```

---

## Git push fails (password prompts, auth errors)

GitHub **does not accept account passwords** for Git over HTTPS. Use a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** or **SSH**.

**HTTPS + PAT (recommended):**

* Create a PAT and use it when Git prompts for a password. Cache credentials with **Git Credential Manager (GCM)** so you’re not asked every time. ([The GitHub Blog][8], [GitHub Docs][9])

**SSH (alternative):**

* Generate an SSH key and add the public key to your GitHub account (**Settings → SSH and GPG keys**). ([GitHub Docs][9])

> Note: Classic “Git Credential Manager for Windows” has been superseded by the cross-platform GCM Core; current Git for Windows includes GCM by default. ([GitHub][10])

---

## Website didn’t update on GitHub Pages

**If you publish via GitHub Actions (recommended):**

1. Check **Actions** → your Pages workflow. Ensure it **uploads** the site as an artifact (e.g., with `actions/upload-pages-artifact`) and then **deploys** it (with `actions/deploy-pages`). ([GitHub][11])
2. In **Settings → Pages**, confirm **Source: GitHub Actions** is selected. ([GitHub Docs][12])

**If you publish from a branch (e.g., `main` + `/docs`):**

* In **Settings → Pages**, set **Source: Deploy from a branch**, choose the correct **branch** and **folder** (`/docs`). The source must exist before it appears in the dropdown. ([GitHub Docs][13])

## Quick diagnostic block (paste into your Console/Terminal)

```r
# R session info
sessionInfo()

# Package + environment checks
library(mccoursepack)
mccourse_self_test()

# Quarto + Git + LaTeX checks
system("quarto --version")
system("git --version")
if (requireNamespace("tinytex", quietly = TRUE)) tinytex::is_tinytex()
```

If you ask for help, include:

* What you ran (copy/paste code),
* The **full** error message,
* Your OS + R + RStudio versions,
* Output of the diagnostic block above.

---

## Still stuck?

* Quarto Troubleshooting (common render/engine issues). ([Quarto][5])
* Quarto PDF engines (TinyTeX install & options). ([Quarto][3])
* RStudio Git/Version Control guide (enable Git for your Project). ([docs.posit.co][1])
* GitHub authentication (use PAT for HTTPS; cache with GCM). ([GitHub Docs][9])

This version gives students precise steps and copy-paste commands, while grounding the solutions in official Quarto, RStudio/Posit, and GitHub docs.
