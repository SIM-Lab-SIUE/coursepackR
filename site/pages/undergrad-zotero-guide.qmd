This guide shows you how to connect Zotero to your RStudio project to create automated citations and bibliographies for your white paper. Much easier than writing a bibliography by hand!

## Why Zotero?

Zotero is a free, open-source reference manager that:
- Saves your academic sources with one click
- Automatically formats citations in any style
- Syncs across devices
- Your whole team can use the same reference library

## Step 1: Install Zotero & Better BibTeX

1. **Install Zotero:** Go to [zotero.org](https://www.zotero.org/) and download the desktop application
2. **Install the Zotero Connector:** Install the browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, or Safari
   - Save sources from Google Scholar with one click
3. **Install Better BibTeX (BBT) Plugin:** Makes citation keys stable
   - Go to [Better BibTeX releases](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/releases)
   - Download the latest `.xpi` file
   - In Zotero: `Tools` → `Add-ons` → Install from file

## Step 2: Create a Team Zotero Library (Optional)

For team collaboration, one person can:
1. Create a Zotero Group Library
2. Share the group link with teammates
3. All team members join the group
4. References sync automatically across the team

Or: One person manages Zotero, exports the `.bib` file, and shares it on GitHub.

## Step 3: Collect Your Sources

1. Open Zotero
2. Create a folder for your project (e.g., "White Paper F25")
3. Use the Zotero Connector to save from Google Scholar, JSTOR, etc.
4. Manually add sources if needed

Aim for **10-12 sources** for your white paper.

## Step 4: Export to BibTeX

1. Right-click your project folder in Zotero
2. Select `Export Collection...`
3. Choose **BibTeX** format
4. Save as `references.bib` in your RStudio project root folder

## Step 5: Configure Quarto

In your `white_paper.qmd`, add to the YAML header:
```yaml
bibliography: references.bib
csl: apa.csl
```

## Step 6: Cite in Your Document

Use the citation key (usually author-year):
```
Research shows X [@smith2023].
```

Quarto formats it as: (Smith, 2023)

## Rendering

When you render your document:
```r
quarto render white_paper.qmd --to pdf
```

Quarto automatically:
1. Inserts in-text citations
2. Creates a formatted bibliography
3. Applies citation style (APA, Chicago, etc.)

## Citation Style

We recommend **APA format** (apa.csl):
- Download from [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles)
- Save as `apa.csl` in your project root

## Team Tips

- **One person manages citations** – to avoid conflicts
- **Share the references.bib file** on GitHub
- **Commit changes** when adding new sources
- **Communicate** about which sources you're using

## Tips

- Keep your library organized with collections
- Use note fields to record page numbers and key quotes
- Export references.bib frequently
- Check citation formatting in your PDF before submission
