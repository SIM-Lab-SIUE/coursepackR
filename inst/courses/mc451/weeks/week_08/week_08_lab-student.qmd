## Week 8: From Concepts to Code

**Textbook Chapter:** 8: The Art of Measurement  
**Dataset:** `simpsons_episodes` (included in the `mccoursepack` package)  
**Core Functions/Packages:** `tidyverse` (for data manipulation and visualization)

### 1. Load the Data

We will use the `simpsons_episodes` dataset to explore the concepts of measurement. Follow these steps:

```r
# Load the required packages
library(mccoursepack)
library(tidyverse)

# Load the dataset
data(simpsons_episodes)

# Confirm the dataset is loaded
head(simpsons_episodes)
```

### 2. Explore Data Types

Understanding the structure of the dataset is the first step in conceptualizing and operationalizing variables.

```r
# View the structure of the dataset
glimpse(simpsons_episodes)

# Discuss: Which columns are numeric, character, or factor?
```

### 3. Summarize Numeric Variables

Summarizing numeric variables helps us identify continuous and categorical variables.

```r
# Get an overview of numeric columns
summary(simpsons_episodes)

# Discuss: Which variables are continuous? Which are categorical?
```

### 4. Convert and Explore Factors

Some variables, like `season`, are stored as integers but are better treated as factors. Factors represent categorical data.

```r
# Convert `season` to a factor
simpsons_episodes <- simpsons_episodes %>%
  mutate(season = factor(season))

# Check the structure again
glimpse(simpsons_episodes)

# Discuss: Why might we want to treat `season` as a factor?
```

### 5. Conceptualization and Operationalization

Let’s connect the dataset to the concepts from Chapter 8:

- **Conceptualization:** Define what we mean by "episode popularity." For example, we might consider `imdb_rating` as an indicator of popularity.
- **Operationalization:** Use the `imdb_rating` column to measure popularity.

```r
# Example: Summarize IMDb ratings
simpsons_episodes %>%
  summarize(
    avg_rating = mean(imdb_rating, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_rating = min(imdb_rating, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_rating = max(imdb_rating, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

### 6. Levels of Measurement

Identify the levels of measurement for key variables:

- **Nominal:** `title` (episode names)
- **Ordinal:** `season` (ordered categories)
- **Interval/Ratio:** `imdb_rating` (continuous scale)

```r
# Discuss: Why is `season` ordinal but `imdb_rating` is ratio?
```

### 7. Reliability and Validity

Reflect on the reliability and validity of the `imdb_rating` variable:

- **Reliability:** Are IMDb ratings consistent across different viewers?
- **Validity:** Do IMDb ratings accurately measure episode quality?

```r
# Discuss: Why is it essential for a measure to be both reliable and valid?
```

### 8. Discussion

- Why is `season` an integer but `imdb_rating` is a double? How does this relate to measurement levels?
- Think about a time you were measured or evaluated. Did the measure feel reliable and valid? Why or why not?
