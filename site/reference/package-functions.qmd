# Function Details

All commands assume you are working inside an RStudio **Project**.

---

## `list_courses()`

```r
list_courses()
````

Returns a character vector of course IDs (e.g., `"mc451"`, `"mc501"`).
If no courses are installed, returns an empty vector.

---

## `list_weeks(course = NULL)`

```r
list_weeks()         # all installed courses
list_weeks("mc451")  # a specific course
```

Returns folder names like `"week_01"`, `"week_02"`, …
Empty if no weeks are installed for that course.

---

## `download_week(course, week, dest = ".")`

```r
download_week("mc451", 1, dest = ".")   # accepts 1, "01", or "week_01"
```

* Creates `dest/week_01/`
* Copies that week’s files into the folder
* Preserves subfolders
* Empty templates still create the folder but copy no files

Returns (invisibly) a list:

```r
list(dest, course, week, n_copied)
```

---

## `open_week(week, dest = ".")`

```r
open_week(1, dest = ".")
```

Opens `dest/week_01/` in your system file browser.

---

## `mccourse_setup(ask = TRUE, pkgs = c(...))`

```r
mccourse_setup()   # safe to re-run
```

Ensures that:

* **Quarto** is installed
* **TinyTeX** (LaTeX) is available for PDF output
* Core **CRAN packages** are installed

---

## `mccourse_self_test()`

```r
mccourse_self_test()
```

Runs a basic check: prints which courses are installed and which weeks are available.

---

## `mccourse_update()`

```r
mccourse_update()
```

Updates **mccoursepack** to the latest GitHub build
(Equivalent to running `pak::pak("SIM-Lab-SIUE/mccoursepack")`).

---

## Common Patterns

* Always open your **RStudio Project** before using package commands.
* Render `.qmd` files to **PDF** (default) or **HTML** with Quarto.
* If PDF rendering fails, run:

```r
mccourse_setup()
```

to install TinyTeX and other dependencies.
