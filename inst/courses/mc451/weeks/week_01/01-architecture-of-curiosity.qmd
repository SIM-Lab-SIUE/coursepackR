## Overview

Welcome to *From Vibes to Variables*. This week introduces the foundational mindset of media research: structured curiosity. You will learn how everyday observations about media can be transformed into researchable questions through the lens of scientific inquiry.

**Reading:** Chapter 1 — The Architecture of Curiosity

## Key Concepts

- The difference between casual observation and systematic inquiry
- How media researchers move from "I wonder..." to testable claims
- The research cycle: observation → question → theory → measurement → analysis → communication
- Why reproducibility matters in media science

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

1. Articulate the difference between anecdotal and empirical reasoning
2. Identify research questions embedded in everyday media consumption
3. Describe the stages of the research process
4. Set up your GitHub profile as a professional research identity

## Assignment: GitHub Profile Setup (25 pts)

### Part 1: Create Your GitHub Account (10 pts)

1. Navigate to [github.com](https://github.com) and create a free account
2. Choose a **professional username** (this will be your public research identity)
3. Add a profile photo and short bio
4. Follow your instructor's GitHub account

### Part 2: Profile README (10 pts)

Create a profile README repository:

1. Create a new repository with the **exact same name** as your GitHub username
2. Initialize it with a README.md file
3. Edit the README to include:
   - Your name and academic program
   - A brief statement of your research interests
   - What you hope to learn in this course

### Part 3: Reflection (5 pts)

In 2–3 sentences, explain: **Why might a public research profile matter for your career, even if you don't plan to become a "scientist"?**

## Discussion Questions

1. Think about a piece of media you consumed this week (song, article, video). What observation could you make about it that might be worth investigating systematically?
2. What is the difference between saying "I think pop songs are getting shorter" and testing whether pop songs are getting shorter?
3. Why do researchers need transparent methods rather than just good intentions?

## Submission Checklist

- [ ] GitHub account created with professional username
- [ ] Profile photo and bio added
