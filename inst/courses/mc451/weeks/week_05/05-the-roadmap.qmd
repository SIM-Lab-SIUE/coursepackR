## Overview

With a data source identified and a theoretical lens selected, it's time to build your research roadmap. This week focuses on finding and annotating a published manuscript that models the kind of research you want to conduct — learning from how professionals structure their work.

**Reading:** Chapter 6 — The Roadmap

## Key Concepts

- The anatomy of a research article (IMRAD structure)
- How to read a research paper strategically (not linearly)
- Annotation as active engagement with scholarship
- Identifying a model manuscript for your own project
- Literature review as conversation, not checklist

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

1. Identify the structural components of a peer-reviewed article
2. Annotate a manuscript using the critical reading protocol
3. Explain how a published study can serve as a template for your own work
4. Locate a relevant peer-reviewed article through library databases

## Assignment: Annotated Manuscript (25 pts)

### Part 1: Find Your Model Manuscript (10 pts)

Using the SIUE library databases, find **one peer-reviewed research article** that:

- Studies a topic related to your research interest
- Uses a method similar to what you plan to use (content analysis, survey, etc.)
- Was published within the last 10 years
- Is from a reputable communication or media journal

### Part 2: Annotate the Manuscript (10 pts)

Using the annotation protocol from the textbook (or the example PDF on the course website), annotate the article focusing on:

- **Introduction:** What gap does the study address? What is the research question?
- **Literature Review:** What theories or frameworks are used? How are key terms defined?
- **Method:** What data was collected? How was it analyzed?
- **Results:** What did they find?
- **Discussion:** What do the findings mean? What are the limitations?

### Part 3: Connection Statement (5 pts)

Write a 1-paragraph statement explaining how this article relates to your planned project. What will you borrow from its approach? What will you do differently?

## Discussion Questions

1. Why is it useful to find a "model manuscript" before designing your own study?
2. What surprised you about the structure of the article you read?
3. How does the literature review section of a paper differ from a summary?

## Submission Checklist

- [ ] Peer-reviewed article located and downloaded
- [ ] Article annotated using the critical reading protocol
- [ ] Connection statement written (1 paragraph)
- [ ] Annotated PDF and statement uploaded to Blackboard
- [ ] Journal entry for Week 5 completed
