## 📖 This Week's Reading

**Textbook**: Chapter 1 - The Science of Storytelling

**Key Concepts**:
- Research as structured storytelling
- The null hypothesis as "sacred flaw"
- Anecdote vs. data: journalism vs. science
- Narrative arc in research design

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will:

- Understand how narrative structure maps onto research design
- Distinguish between anecdotal evidence and systematic data
- Identify the components of a research story (inciting incident, protagonist, antagonist, climax)
- Recognize your own cognitive biases and prediction errors

## 📝 Assignment: Identifying Research Narratives

### Part 1: Analyzing a Published Study

Read the following abstract (fictional example for demonstration):

> **Parasocial Bonds and Financial Risk**: This study examined whether parasocial relationships with social media influencers predict cryptocurrency investment behavior among young adults (n=450). Followers with strong parasocial bonds were 3.2 times more likely to invest in cryptocurrencies mentioned by influencers, controlling for financial literacy (p < .001). These findings suggest regulatory attention to influencer finance content may be warranted.

**Your Task**: Identify the narrative elements from Chapter 1.

1. **Inciting Incident** (What anomaly sparked this research?):

[Your answer here]

2. **Protagonist** (Who is seeking truth?):

[Your answer here]

3. **Antagonist** (What chaos obscures truth?):

[Your answer here]

4. **Theory as Training** (What framework guides the inquiry?):

[Your answer here]

5. **Climax** (What was the statistical test/finding?):

[Your answer here]

6. **Resolution** (What are the implications?):

[Your answer here]

### Part 2: From Anecdote to Research Question

Think of a media phenomenon you've observed personally. Examples:

- "TikTok algorithms seem to radicalize users by pushing extreme content"
- "Streamers who use webcams seem to get more donations"
- "Reddit communities have different toxicity levels depending on their topic"
- "Podcast listeners feel more connected to hosts than radio listeners"

**Step 1**: Write your observation as an **anecdote** (2-3 sentences, narrative style)

[Your anecdote here]

**Step 2**: Transform it into a **research question** (1 sentence, formal phrasing)

[Your research question here]

**Step 3**: What **data** would you need to test this systematically?

- Sample: [Who/what would you study?]
- Variables: [What would you measure?]
- Method: [How would you collect data?]

**Step 4**: What **theory** might explain this pattern? (Make an educated guess - we'll learn formal theories in Chapter 5)

[Your theoretical intuition here]

### Part 3: Reflection on Cognitive Bias

Chapter 1 discusses the brain as a "prediction machine" that experiences dissonance when predictions fail.

**Recall a time** when your prediction about media was proven wrong by evidence:

- What was your initial belief (your "sacred flaw")?
- What evidence contradicted it?
- Did you update your belief or reject the evidence? Why?

[Your reflection here - aim for 200-300 words]

## 💭 Discussion Questions

Be prepared to discuss in class:

1. The textbook argues that anecdotes provide "emotional resonance" while data provides "evidentiary weight." Can you think of a news story or social media post that combined both effectively?

2. Why might mass communication students initially resist learning research methods? How does framing research as storytelling address that resistance?

3. The "Twitch in the Time of Quarantine" study found that users weren't actually seeking interpersonal connection (tagging others) but were "screaming into the void" (broadcasting emotions to general chat). Does this surprise you? Why or why not?
