## Why version control?

Git keeps a complete history of your work, lets you roll back mistakes, and makes sharing/submitting changes straightforward. In Git you **stage** changes, then **commit** them as a snapshot; later you **push** those commits to GitHub to back them up and collaborate.

---

## Install & enable Git in RStudio (one time)

1. **Install Git**: https://git-scm.com/downloads  
2. In **RStudio**: **Tools → Global Options → Git/SVN**  
   - Check **Enable version control interface for RStudio projects**  
   - Ensure the Git executable path is detected (set it if blank)  
   - Optional (advanced): generate or add an SSH key here.

Tip: The presence of the **Git** pane in RStudio indicates your Project is under Git. If not, convert it via **Tools → Project Options → Git/SVN → Version control system: Git** (or run `git init` in the project folder).

## Authenticate to GitHub

GitHub no longer accepts account passwords for Git over HTTPS. Use **HTTPS + Personal Access Token (PAT)** or **SSH keys**.

- **HTTPS + PAT (recommended)**  
  Create a fine-grained PAT, grant it access to your repo(s), and let Git Credential Manager cache it so you aren’t prompted every push.  
  Docs: https://docs.github.com/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token  
  Git Credential Manager: https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager

- **SSH (alternative)**  
  Generate an SSH key and add the **public key** in **GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys**.  
  Docs: https://docs.github.com/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh

## Create a GitHub repo & connect your RStudio Project

You have two clean paths—pick one.

### A) Start local, then create the GitHub repo
1. In your RStudio **Project** (already has files), ensure it’s a Git repo.  
2. Create/connect the GitHub repo:

**R helper (usethis):**
```r
install.packages("usethis")
usethis::use_git()       # initialize git (if needed)
usethis::use_github()    # creates repo on GitHub, adds 'origin', pushes
````

**Manual (shell):**

```bash
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR-ORG>/<REPO>.git
git push -u origin main
```

### B) Start from GitHub, then clone into RStudio

* On GitHub, click **New** repository → create it (with a README if you want).
* In RStudio: **File → New Project → Version Control → Git**, paste the repo URL, choose a local folder, **Create Project**.

---

## Daily workflow (RStudio Git pane)

1. **Pull** (get changes from GitHub)
2. **Stage** the files you changed
3. **Commit** with a short message
4. **Push** to GitHub

Command line equivalents:

```bash
git pull
git add -A
git commit -m "Brief, meaningful message"
git push
```

---

## Good habits

* Commit small, logical units of work with clear messages.
* Pull before you start; pull again if a push is rejected.
* Keep secrets and large raw data out of the repo (use `.gitignore`).

**Recommended `.gitignore` for this course repo**

```
.Rhistory
.Rproj.user/
.RData
.DS_Store
site/_site/
docs/
*.local.*
*.env
```

---

## Troubleshooting

* **RStudio doesn’t show the Git pane** → Enable Git for the Project (Project Options → Git/SVN) or initialize with `usethis::use_git()`.
* **Push asks for a password** → Use a **PAT** for HTTPS; when Git prompts for a password, paste your token. Enable Git Credential Manager to remember it.
* **“Rejected – fetch first”** → Someone pushed ahead of you. Run `git pull`, resolve any merge conflicts, then commit and push.
