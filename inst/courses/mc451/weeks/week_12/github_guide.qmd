# Guide to Collaborating with GitHub

Using Git and GitHub is the professional standard for managing projects. For a 2-3 person team, this workflow will prevent lost work and merge conflicts.

### **Step 1: One Person Creates the Repository**

1.  One team member (the "Repo Owner") goes to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/ "null").

2.  Create a new **private** repository. Name it clearly (e.g., `coms-white-paper-f24`).

3.  **IMPORTANT:** Check the box to **"Add a README file"**.

4.  Go to the repository's `Settings` \> `Collaborators` and add your teammates using their GitHub usernames.

### **Step 2: All Members Clone the Repository**

Once your teammates accept the invitation, *every* team member (including the owner) must "clone" the repository to their computer. This creates a local copy.

1.  Go to the repository's main page on GitHub.

2.  Click the green `<> Code` button.

3.  Copy the `HTTPS` URL.

4.  In RStudio, go to `File` \> `New Project...` \> `Version Control` \> `Git`.

5.  Paste the URL into the `Repository URL` field.

6.  Choose a location on your computer for the project to live.

7.  Click "Create Project." RStudio will restart and open your new project, which is now a Git repository.

### **Step 3: The Daily Workflow (Pull, Edit, Commit, Push)**

**This is the most important part.** Follow this cycle *every time* you start and stop working.

#### **A. PULL (Before you start work)**

*Before you write a single word,* you must "pull" any changes your teammates have made.

1.  Open your RStudio project.

2.  Go to the **`Git`** tab in the top-right pane.

3.  Click the **`Pull`** button (blue down-arrow). This fetches all changes from GitHub.

#### **B. EDIT (Do your work)**

-   Now you can safely work on your files (e.g., write in the `.qmd` file, add R code).

-   **Communicate!** Tell your team, "I'm working on the Methodology section." This helps avoid "merge conflicts" where two people edit the same lines at the same time.

#### **C. COMMIT (Save your changes)**

When you've finished a chunk of work (or at the end of the day), you must "commit" your changes. This is like taking a local snapshot.

1.  Go to the **`Git`** tab.

2.  Check the boxes next to the files you've changed.

3.  Click **`Commit`**.

4.  A new window will open. In the `Commit message` box, write a *brief* description of what you did (e.g., "Drafted methodology section" or "Fixed ggplot2 chart").

5.  Click **`Commit`**.

#### **D. PUSH (Share your changes)**

Your "commit" is still only on your computer. To share it with your team, you must "push" it to GitHub.

1.  After committing, click the **`Push`** button (green up-arrow) on the `Git` tab.

2.  Your changes are now on GitHub, and your teammates can "pull" them.

**Cycle:** `Pull` -\> `Edit` -\> `Commit` -\> `Push` -\> `(Teammate Pulls)`

### **Step 4: The Final Repository Structure**

Your final repository *must* be organized. Create these folders inside your RStudio project:

```         
/your-project-repository ├── white_paper.qmd       <-- Your main Quarto file ├── references.bib        <-- Your bibliography file ├── README.md             <-- A brief description of your project │ ├── /data │   ├── survey_data_raw.csv   <-- The raw data from your survey │ ├── /output │   └── white_paper.pdf       <-- The final, rendered PDF of your paper │ └── (Your RStudio .Rproj file will also be here)  
```
