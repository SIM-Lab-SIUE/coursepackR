## Troubleshooting

::: {.callout-note}
**Q: I see a warning about missing or unexported objects: 'pak::pkg_diff' or 'quarto::quarto_install'. Should I worry?**

**A:** No. This is a harmless warning caused by how these packages export their functions. The `mccoursepack` package uses fully qualified calls (e.g., `pak::pkg_diff()`), and as long as you have the `pak` and `quarto` packages installed, everything will work as intended. You can safely ignore this warning.
