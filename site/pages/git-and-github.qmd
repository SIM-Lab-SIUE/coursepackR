### Why version control?
It tracks changes, enables backups, and makes submissions easy.

### Setup in RStudio
- **Tools → Global Options → Git/SVN**: confirm Git is detected.
- Sign in to GitHub in your browser; you’ll create repos for your journal and (later) your portfolio.

### The basic flow
- **Stage → Commit → Push** in the Git pane.
