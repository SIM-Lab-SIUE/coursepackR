# Graduate Research Paper: Project Overview

This is an individual project requiring you to produce a professional, APA-style research paper of approximately **6,000–8,000 words**. You will identify a mass communications problem, conduct a comprehensive review of the academic literature, and execute original survey research (Goal: 100+ responses) to generate new insights.

The entire project will be built in **RStudio using Quarto**, and your submission will be twofold: the final manuscript (PDF) on Blackboard and the complete RProject via GitHub.

### **Core Requirements**

-   **Project:** Individual (no teams).

-   **Length:** 6,000–8,000 words (excluding references, tables, and appendices).

-   **Sources:** 15-20 academic, peer-reviewed citations.

-   **Research:** One original survey (N=100 goal) or an alternative, pre-approved methodology.

-   **Questions:** Exactly two (2) Research Questions (RQs) and/or Hypotheses (RHs).

-   **Analysis:** All data must be analyzed using RStudio.

-   **Visuals:** At least two (2) data visualizations (e.g., tables, figures) created in R and formatted for APA style.

-   **Format:** APA 7th Edition style, written in a Quarto (`.qmd`) file.

-   **Style:** Must meet professional and academic standards.

### **Final Deliverables**

1.  **Blackboard Submission:** The final, rendered `research_paper.pdf` manuscript.

2.  **GitHub Submission:** A link to your private GitHub repository, which must contain:

    -   `research_paper.qmd`: Your main Quarto file.

    -   `references.bib`: Your bibliography file.

    -   `README.md`: A brief abstract of your project.

    -   A `/data` folder containing your raw `survey_data.csv`.

    -   An `/output` folder containing the final rendered `research_paper.pdf`.

### **Master Project Checklist**

Use this checklist to track your progress.

#### **Phase 1: Setup & Planning (Week 1-2)**

-   [ ] Finalize your research topic.

-   [ ] Get your topic and RQs/RHs approved by your instructor.

-   [ ] Create your private GitHub repository (see `grad_github_guide.md`).

-   [ ] Clone the repository to your local machine via RStudio.


# Project Overview (Summary)

-   [ ] Check that all 15-20 sources are cited correctly.

-   [ ] Check that your R code runs and your visualizations render properly.

-   [ ] Render your final `research_paper.pdf` and add it to the `/output` folder.

-   [ ] Push all final changes to GitHub.

-   [ ] **Submit the `research_paper.pdf` to Blackboard.**

-   [ ] **Submit your GitHub repository link.**
