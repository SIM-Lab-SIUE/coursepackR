## Overview

Statistical significance tells you whether a finding is *real*. Effect sizes tell you whether it *matters*. This week moves beyond p-values to understand the magnitude and practical importance of your findings — a critical skill for responsible data interpretation.

**Reading:** Chapter 15 — Interpreting the Call

## Key Concepts

- Effect sizes: Cohen's d, Cramér's V, correlation coefficients
- Confidence intervals as a complement to p-values
- Practical significance vs. statistical significance
- The replication crisis and why effect sizes matter
- Interpreting results in context
- Limitations and alternative explanations

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

1. Calculate and interpret common effect size measures
2. Construct and interpret confidence intervals
3. Distinguish between statistical and practical significance
4. Write a discussion section connecting findings to your research question
5. Acknowledge limitations honestly

## Assignment: Describing Data in R (25 pts)

### Part 1: Effect Size Calculations (10 pts)

Return to the analyses you conducted last week and calculate effect sizes:

- For t-tests: Calculate **Cohen's d**
- For chi-square: Calculate **Cramér's V**
- For correlations: The correlation coefficient **r** is already an effect size

```r
# Cohen's d (manual calculation)
group1 <- subset_data$var[subset_data$group == "A"]
group2 <- subset_data$var[subset_data$group == "B"]
cohens_d <- (mean(group1) - mean(group2)) /
  sqrt((sd(group1)^2 + sd(group2)^2) / 2)
```

Interpret each effect size using standard benchmarks (small, medium, large).

### Part 2: Confidence Intervals (5 pts)

For one of your analyses, report the 95% confidence interval and explain:
- What does this interval represent?
- How does it complement the p-value?

### Part 3: Discussion Draft (10 pts)

Write a 2-paragraph discussion section that:

1. **Interprets your findings:** What do the results mean in the context of your research question? How do they connect to the theory/framework you identified earlier?
2. **Acknowledges limitations:** What are the weaknesses of your study? What alternative explanations exist? What would you do differently?

## Discussion Questions

1. A study finds a statistically significant difference with Cohen's d = 0.08. Should we be impressed? Why or why not?
2. Why has the research community increasingly called for reporting effect sizes alongside p-values?
3. What is a confidence interval, and why is "95% confident" often misunderstood?
