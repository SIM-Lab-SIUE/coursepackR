## 📖 This Week's Reading

**Textbook**: Chapter 8 - From Vibes to Variables

**Key Concepts**:
- Operationalization: making abstract concepts measurable
- Levels of measurement (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio)
- Validity: are you measuring what you think you're measuring?
- Reliability: would different coders reach the same conclusion?

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will:

- Transform qualitative observations ("vibes") into quantitative variables
- Choose appropriate levels of measurement for your research question
- Identify potential threats to validity and reliability
- Draft operational definitions for your project variables

## 📝 Assignment: Operationalizing Your Variables

This week's assignment directly advances your semester project. You'll define HOW to measure the concepts in your research question.

### Part 1: Reviewing Your Research Question

**From your Project Brief (Week 7)**, restate your research question:

[Your research question here]

**Key concepts** (the abstract ideas you need to measure):

1. [Concept 1]
2. [Concept 2]
3. [Concept 3 - if applicable]

### Part 2: Operationalizing Each Variable

For EACH concept above, complete the following template:

---

#### Variable 1: [Name]

**Conceptual Definition** (What does this mean in everyday language?):

[Your definition here]

**Operational Definition** (How will you measure it? Be SPECIFIC):

[Your definition here]

Example:
- ❌ Bad: "Toxicity is mean behavior"
- ✅ Good: "Toxicity is operationalized as the presence of profanity, personal attacks, hate speech, or harassment in chat messages, coded as binary (0 = absent, 1 = present)"

**Level of Measurement**:

- [ ] Nominal (categories with no order, e.g., game genre)
- [ ] Ordinal (categories with order, e.g., low/medium/high engagement)
- [ ] Interval (numeric with meaningful distances but no true zero, e.g., Likert scales)
- [ ] Ratio (numeric with true zero, e.g., number of messages)

[Explain your choice]

**Example Values**:

Provide 3 examples of how real data would be coded:

1. Example 1: [Specific case] → Coded as [value]
2. Example 2: [Specific case] → Coded as [value]
3. Example 3: [Specific case] → Coded as [value]

**Potential Validity Threats** (Is this measure capturing what you intend?):

[Your answer here - what could go wrong?]

**Potential Reliability Threats** (Would two coders agree?):

[Your answer here - what's ambiguous?]

---

#### Variable 2: [Name]

[Repeat the template above]

---

#### Variable 3: [Name] (if applicable)

[Repeat the template above]

---

### Part 3: Testing Your Operationalization

Now test your operational definitions by hand-coding 5 example units.

**Units of Analysis** (What are you coding?):
- [ ] Individual messages/posts
- [ ] Entire streams/videos
- [ ] User profiles
- [ ] Other: ___________

**Your 5 Test Cases**:

Create a simple table showing how you'd code real examples:

| Unit ID | Description | Variable 1 | Variable 2 | Variable 3 | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | [Brief description] | [Value] | [Value] | [Value] | [Any coding challenges] |
| 2 | [Brief description] | [Value] | [Value] | [Value] | [Any coding challenges] |
| 3 | [Brief description] | [Value] | [Value] | [Value] | [Any coding challenges] |
| 4 | [Brief description] | [Value] | [Value] | [Value] | [Any coding challenges] |
| 5 | [Brief description] | [Value] | [Value] | [Value] | [Any coding challenges] |

**Reflection on Test Coding** (200-300 words):

- What was harder to code than you expected?
- Did you need to revise your operational definitions after trying them out?
- What edge cases did you encounter?
- How would you train another coder to use your definitions?

[Your reflection here]

### Part 4: Variable Types in R

In R, variables have specific data types. Indicate how each of your variables will be stored:

| Your Variable | R Data Type | Why? |
|--------------|-------------|------|
| [Variable 1] | `numeric` / `character` / `factor` / `logical` | [Explanation] |
| [Variable 2] | `numeric` / `character` / `factor` / `logical` | [Explanation] |
| [Variable 3] | `numeric` / `character` / `factor` / `logical` | [Explanation] |

**Example Explanation**:
> "Chat toxicity will be stored as `logical` (TRUE/FALSE) because it's a binary presence/absence variable. This allows easy counting with `sum()` in R."

## 🧪 Hands-On: Simulating Your Variables

Create a small simulated dataset in R that demonstrates your variable structure:

```{r}
#| label: simulate-data

library(tidyverse)

# Simulate data for your project
my_project_data <- tibble(
  unit_id = 1:20,  # 20 example units
  
  # Replace these with YOUR variables
  variable_1 = sample(c("A", "B", "C"), 20, replace = TRUE),  # Example nominal
  variable_2 = sample(1:10, 20, replace = TRUE),              # Example ratio
  variable_3 = sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 20, replace = TRUE)     # Example binary
)

# Display
my_project_data
```

**Describe your simulated data**:

- How many units (rows)?
- How many variables (columns)?
- Does this structure match your real project needs?

## 💭 Discussion Questions

1. Chapter 8 emphasizes that operationalization is both **science** (systematic) and **art** (interpretive). Where did you experience tension between precision and practicality in defining your variables?

2. The textbook discusses "vibes" as qualitative intuition. What "vibe" sparked your research question, and how does quantifying it change (or enhance) your understanding?

3. If you were hiring a second coder to help with your project, what would be the hardest variable to train them on? Why?

## ✅ Submission Checklist

- [ ] All three variables operationalized with complete templates
- [ ] Test coding of 5 units included with reflection
- [ ] R simulation code executes without errors
- [ ] All questions answered thoroughly
- [ ] Document renders to HTML successfully
- [ ] File naming: `Week09_[YourLastName].qmd` and `.html`

## 📚 Resources

- **Textbook**: Chapter 8 (full_textbook.md, lines 2842-3314)
- **Next Week**: Chapter 9 (The Rulebook) - you'll formalize these operational definitions into a codebook
- **Example Codebooks**: See inst/examples/ in your course package (if provided by instructor)

## 🎯 Looking Ahead

Next week, you'll use these operational definitions to build a **codebook**—the complete rulebook for coding your data. Think of this week's assignment as your rough draft. If you discover problems later, you can revise. Research is iterative!
