title: "R & RStudio"
---

### R vs. RStudio
- **R** is the language.
- **RStudio** is the IDE that makes R pleasant.

### Projects
Always work inside an RStudio **Project** for this course. It keeps paths sane.

### Console and Script
- Use the Console for quick commands.
- Put code you want to keep in a `.qmd` or `.R` script and save it.
