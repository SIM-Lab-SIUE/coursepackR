The `final_project()` function now creates a complete folder structure and starter files for your final assignment in **MC501** (graduate research paper) or **MC451** (undergraduate group white paper).

## Quick Start

Run `final_project("mc501")` or `final_project("mc451")` in R to generate your project folder.

Each template includes:
- A Quarto manuscript (`.qmd`)
- Bibliography database (`references.bib`)
- Data folder (`/data`)
- Output folder (`/output`)
- README and project file

Central guides for technical setup, writing, GitHub, and Zotero are included for both project types.
