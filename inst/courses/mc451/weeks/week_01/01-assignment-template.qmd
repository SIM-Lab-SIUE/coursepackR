## Overview

Welcome to the course! This week you'll:

- Set up your RStudio environment
- Learn basic R syntax
- Read and explore your first dataset
- Create your first visualization

## Setup Instructions

Before starting this assignment, complete `mccourse_setup()`:

```r
# Run this once
mccourse_setup()

# Then verify everything works
mccourse_self_test()
```

## Part 1: Load and Explore Data

Load the starter data:

```r
# Load required packages
library(tidyverse)

# Read the data (adjust path based on where you downloaded it)
data <- read_csv("data.csv")

# View the structure
head(data)
str(data)
summary(data)
```

**Questions to explore:**
1. How many rows and columns?
2. What are the data types?
3. Any missing values?

## Part 2: Basic Analysis

Calculate summary statistics:

```r
# Your code here
mean_value <- mean(data$column_name)
```

## Part 3: Visualization

Create a simple plot:

```r
ggplot(data, aes(x = variable1, y = variable2)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Submission
