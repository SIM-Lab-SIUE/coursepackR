# Graduate Project GitHub Guide

This guide covers all steps for using GitHub in your research project, including setup, version control, and submission.

## Why Use GitHub?
- Version control: Save snapshots, roll back changes.
- Cloud backup: Protect your work.
- Portability: Work from any computer.
- Submission: Required for your final project.

## Steps
1. Create a private repository on GitHub (e.g., `grad-research-paper-f24`).
2. Add a README file.
3. Clone the repository to RStudio using the HTTPS URL.
4. Work in your local RStudio Project, commit changes, and push to GitHub regularly.
5. Submit your GitHub link as part of your final deliverables.
