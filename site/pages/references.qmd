This page documents the functions students actually use. All commands assume you’re working inside an RStudio **Project** (so relative paths behave). For why we push Projects so hard, see the “project-oriented workflow” guidance. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## At a glance

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `list_courses()` | Lists installed course IDs (e.g., `"mc451"`, `"mc501"`). |
| `list_weeks(course = NULL)` | Lists available week folders (e.g., `"week_01"`) for a course; if `NULL`, aggregates across courses. |
| `download_week(course, week, dest=".")` | Creates **`week_XX/`** under `dest` and copies that week’s files there. |
| `open_week(week, dest=".")` | Opens the local `week_XX/` folder in your file browser. |
| `mccourse_setup(ask = TRUE, pkgs = c(...))` | One-time helper: installs Quarto, TinyTeX (for PDF), and core CRAN packages if missing. |
| `mccourse_self_test()` | Prints what courses/weeks the package can see (sanity check). |
| `mccourse_update()` | Convenience to update **mccoursepack** to the latest GitHub build (wrapper around your chosen installer). |

> Note on where templates live: in R packages, everything under `inst/` is available after install and can be found via `system.file(...)`. That’s how the package locates course/week templates. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## `list_courses()`

**Usage**
```r
list_courses()
````

**Returns**
A character vector of course IDs (e.g., `"mc451"`, `"mc501"`). Empty vector if none are installed.

**Notes**

* Courses are detected under the package’s installed `courses/` folder.

---

## `list_weeks(course = NULL)`

**Usage**

```r
list_weeks()           # aggregate across all installed courses
list_weeks("mc451")    # weeks for a specific course
```

**Returns**
Character vector of folder names like `"week_01"`, `"week_02"`, … (empty if none).

**Notes**

* With `course = NULL`, the function looks across all installed courses and returns the unique set of week directories.

---

## `download_week(course, week, dest = ".")`

**Usage**

```r
download_week("mc451", 1, dest = ".")   # also accepts "01" or "week_01"
```

**Behavior**

* Creates `dest/week_01/` (or `week_XX/`) and copies that week’s files **into** the folder.
* Preserves any internal subfolders.
* If a week template is intentionally empty (e.g., break/holiday), it still creates the `week_XX/` folder but copies no files.

**Returns (invisibly)**
A list: `list(dest = <path>, course = <chr>, week = <"01">, n_copied = <int>)`.

**Gotchas**

* Keep your course Project path short on Windows to avoid long-path issues.
* If you don’t pass `course` and more than one course is installed, the function will ask you to be explicit.

---

## `open_week(week, dest = ".")`

**Usage**

```r
open_week(1, dest = ".")
```

**Behavior**
Opens the folder `dest/week_01/` in your system file browser (via `utils::browseURL()`).

**Returns**
Invisibly, the path it opened.

---

## `mccourse_setup(ask = TRUE, pkgs = c(...))`

**Usage**

```r
mccourse_setup()   # safe to re-run; installs only what's missing
```

**What it does**

* Ensures **Quarto** is installed (the engine that renders `.qmd` files).
* Ensures **TinyTeX** (LaTeX) is available for **PDF** output. Quarto needs a TeX engine to render PDFs. ([Quarto][1])
* Installs/updates a small set of **core CRAN packages** used across course materials.

**Arguments**

* `ask` — whether to prompt before big installs (default `TRUE`).
* `pkgs` — vector of CRAN package names to ensure are installed.

**Verification**

```r
# Quarto present?
system("quarto --version")
# TinyTeX present?
if (requireNamespace("tinytex", quietly = TRUE)) tinytex::is_tinytex()
```

---

## `mccourse_self_test()`

**Usage**

```r
mccourse_self_test()
```

**What it does**
Prints the courses found and the weeks available for each. Returns `TRUE` invisibly if templates are discoverable.

---

## `mccourse_update()`

**Usage**

```r
mccourse_update()
```

**What it does**
Updates **mccoursepack** to the latest version from GitHub using your configured installer (e.g., `pak` or “remotes”). If you prefer to do this manually:

```r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("SIM-Lab-SIUE/mccoursepack")
# or:
# remotes::install_github("SIM-Lab-SIUE/mccoursepack", upgrade = "always", force = TRUE)
```

---

## Common patterns

### Work inside a Project

Open the `.Rproj`, then run package commands. Projects keep working directories stable and path-safe. ([tidyverse.org][2])

### Render to PDF (templates default to PDF-first)

Open a `.qmd` in the `week_XX/` folder and click **Render**. If you see a “No TeX installation detected” error, install TinyTeX (or re-run `mccourse_setup()`); Quarto needs LaTeX for PDF. ([Quarto][1])

---

## Further reading

* **Quarto projects** (how we keep the docs site confined to `site/` and control what renders). Use the `project.render` whitelist in `_quarto.yml`. ([Quarto][3])
* **Installed files in R packages** (`inst/` → `system.file(...)`). ([r-pkgs.org][4])
* **Why Projects matter** (less path chaos, more reproducibility). ([tidyverse.org][2])

```

**Citations explain the general claims**: Quarto’s PDF → LaTeX requirement, how Quarto projects constrain what renders, and how R packages expose `inst/` files. The function-specific behavior is based on your package code.
