# Technical Guide (Summary)

For full technical setup instructions—including RStudio, Quarto, package installation, and survey design—see the central guide:

[Technical Guide: RStudio, Quarto, & Survey Design](../../../../guides/grad_technical_guide.md)

**Key reminders for MC501:** - Follow the central guide for setup and troubleshooting. - Ask your instructor if you encounter technical issues. \#### **5. R Code Chunks**

...

1.  In RStudio, go to `File` \> `New File...` \> `Quarto Document...`.

2.  Save the file as `research_paper.qmd`.

3.  This file will have a **YAML header**. You *must* edit it to look like this:

    ```         
    --- title: "Your Full Title Here" author: "Your Name" format:    pdf:     keep-tex: true editor: visual bibliography: references.bib csl: apa.csl abstract: |   Your 250-word abstract goes here. Write this last. ---  
    ```

    -   `bibliography: references.bib`: Tells Quarto where your Zotero citations are.

    -   `csl: apa.csl`: Tells Quarto to use the APA 7 style file you just downloaded.

    -   `abstract: |`: This creates a properly formatted abstract block.

#### **5. R Code Chunks**

-   Use `echo: false` and `warning: false` on your R code chunks to hide the code itself, as per APA style. You only want to show the *output* (the tables or figures).

    -   Example: `{r, echo=false, warning=false, message=false}`

-   Use `apaTables::apa.cor.table()` or `apaTables::apa.reg.table()` to generate Word/Latex code for APA-formatted tables, which you can then place in your document.

### **Part 2: Survey Design Best Practices**

Your goal is 100+ responses. A well-designed survey is crucial for a graduate-level project.

#### **1. Ethics First**

-   **Anonymity:** You *must* ensure your survey is anonymous. Do not ask for names or emails.

-   **Informed Consent:** Your first "question" must be a consent page. Explain:

    -   Who you are and that this is for a graduate class project.

    -   That participation is voluntary and anonymous.

    -   That they can quit at any time.

    -   An "I agree to participate" button must be clicked to proceed.

-   **Get Approval:** Get your survey questions approved by your instructor *before* you launch.

#### **2. Use Validated Scales**

-   This is a key difference for grad-level work. Do *not* make up your own questions to measure complex variables (like "brand loyalty" or "body dissatisfaction").

-   **Find Scales:** Use Google Scholar to find papers on your topic. Look at their "Method" section to see *how* they measured your variable. Find the original paper that *created* that scale.

-   **Cite Your Measures:** In your `Method` section, you will cite the authors of the scale you used.

    -   *Example:* "Brand loyalty was measured using the 5-item scale developed by Smith (2019)..."

#### **3. Keep It Focused**

-   Only ask questions that *directly* help you measure your variables (independent, dependent) and any important demographic/control variables (e.g., age, gender, time on social media).
