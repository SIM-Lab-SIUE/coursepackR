title: "Week 8 Lab: Understanding Data Types and Classes"

## Week 8: From Concepts to Code

**Textbook Chapter:** 8: The Art of Measurement **Dataset:** `simpsons_episodes.rda` (from the `data` folder) **Core Functions/Packages:** `glimpse()`, `summary()`, `factor()` from the tidyverse

### Lab Activities

1.  **Load the Data**
    -   Use `load("data/simpsons_episodes.rda")` to load the dataset.
    -   Confirm the object name (should be `simpsons_episodes`).
2.  **Explore Data Types**
    -   Use `dplyr::glimpse(simpsons_episodes)` to view the structure and types of each column.
    -   Discuss: Which columns are numeric, character, or factor?
3.  **Summarize Numeric Variables**
    -   Use `summary(simpsons_episodes)` to get an overview of the numeric columns.
    -   Which variables are continuous? Which are categorical?
4.  **Convert and Explore Factors**
    -   Use `mutate()` and `factor()` to convert appropriate columns (e.g., `season`) to factors.
    -   Discuss: Why might we want to treat `season` as a factor?
5.  **Discussion**
    -   Why is `season` an integer but `imdb_rating` is a double? How does this relate to measurement levels?
