## Overview

The research question is the single most important sentence in your project. This week teaches you how to move from a broad interest to a focused, answerable research question — and how to formalize your project plan in a prospectus document.

**Reading:** Chapter 7 — The Research Question

## Key Concepts

- Characteristics of a good research question (specific, measurable, feasible)
- The difference between research questions and hypotheses
- Operationalization: turning abstract concepts into measurable variables
- The prospectus as a contract with yourself
- Narrowing scope without losing ambition

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

1. Craft a focused, answerable research question
2. Distinguish between descriptive, relational, and causal research questions
3. Explain how your research question connects to your theoretical framework
4. Complete a formal project prospectus

## Assignment: Project Prospectus (25 pts)

The prospectus is your project blueprint. Using the template provided, complete the following sections:

### Section 1: Topic and Rationale (5 pts)
- What is your research topic?
- Why does it matter? (academic and/or practical significance)
- What gap in knowledge does your project address?

### Section 2: Research Question(s) (10 pts)
- State your primary research question
- If applicable, state 1–2 secondary questions or hypotheses
- For each, identify the key variables/concepts involved

### Section 3: Proposed Method (5 pts)
- What method will you use? (content analysis, survey, etc.)
- What data will you analyze? (reference your Archivist Report)
- What is your anticipated sample or dataset?

### Section 4: Timeline (5 pts)
- Map your remaining semester weeks to specific project milestones
- Identify potential challenges and contingency plans

## Discussion Questions

1. What makes a research question "good" vs. "too broad" or "too narrow"?
2. How does your theoretical framework inform the specific question you're asking?
3. What is the difference between a research question and a hypothesis?
