**Quarto not found**  
Install Quarto (or run `mccourse_setup()`).

**PDF failed to render**  
Run `mccourse_setup()` to install TinyTeX.

**Files didn’t appear**  
Check you’re inside your Project folder (`getwd()`), then re-run `download_week("mc451", 1, dest = ".")`.

**Git push failed**  
Set up Git in RStudio (**Tools → Global Options → Git/SVN**) and authenticate with GitHub.
