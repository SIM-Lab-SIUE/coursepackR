# RStudio’s Four Panes: A Practical Tour for First-Time Users

RStudio organizes your work into **four panes**. Each pane has tabs for specific tasks: editing, running code, viewing objects, managing files, plots, packages, or help. This page gives you a plain-English tour of every pane and every default tab—what each does, when you’ll use it, and where to click next.

## 1. Source Pane (Top-Left) — Where You Write and Edit

**What it is:** a multi-tab code and document editor. You’ll draft R scripts (`.R`), Quarto/R Markdown (`.qmd`, `.Rmd`), plain text, and more here. Code doesn’t execute until you send it to the Console.

- Tabs across the top hold open files—click a tab to switch documents.  
- For Quarto/R Markdown, you can use the visual editor and render from the toolbar; output previews in the **Viewer** (see Output pane).

## 2. Console Pane (Bottom-Left) — Where Code Runs (Plus Two Neighbors)

This column has three tabs by default:

### a. Console
An interactive R prompt. Type a command (e.g., `1 + 1`) and press **Return** to see results immediately. Most beginners will (1) write code in the Source pane and (2) send lines or chunks to the Console to execute.  

### b. Terminal
A system shell inside RStudio (bash/zsh on macOS/Linux; PowerShell/Command Prompt on Windows). Supports multiple sessions—handy for Git, package tools, or command-line utilities.  

### c. Background Jobs
Runs an R script in a separate R session so long tasks don’t freeze your main session. Start jobs from this tab or by choosing *Source as Background Job*. Progress and logs appear here.  

::: tip
If something works in the Console but stalls your session, launch it as a background job. If you need shell tools, hop to Terminal.

## 3. Environment Pane (Top-Right) — What’s in Memory (Plus History & Tooling)

By default this pane includes **Environment, History, Connections, Build, VCS, and Tutorial**.

- **Environment:** Live list of objects in your R session (data frames, vectors, models). Inspect, remove, or clear objects and launch the spreadsheet-style data viewer.  
- **History:** Log of commands you’ve executed. Search, select, and resend to Console or a script.  
- **Connections:** Shows active database/data-source connections.  
- **Build:** Appears in projects with build tooling (e.g., an R package). Buttons for Install & Restart, Load All, Run R CMD check, clean/rebuild, and run tests.  
- **VCS:** Git/SVN integration (commit, diff, pull/push, project-level settings).  
- **Tutorial:** Runs interactive *learnr* tutorials inside the IDE.

## 4. Output Pane (Bottom-Right) — Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Web Output, Slides

By default this pane includes **Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer, and Presentation**.

- **Files:** Browse folders, open files into Source, rename/move/delete, upload/download (when using server/cloud).  
- **Plots:** Displays graphs. Navigate through plot history, pop out to a window, and export (PNG/PDF).  
- **Packages:** Lists installed packages; load/unload with a click. Install/Update tools included.  
- **Help:** Documentation for functions and packages (same as R’s help, in a browser-style panel).  
- **Viewer:** Renders local HTML (Shiny apps, htmlwidgets, Quarto previews, etc.).  
- **Presentation:** IDE panel for authoring HTML5 slides (*R Presentations*).

## Customizing Your Layout

Go to **Tools → Global Options → Pane Layout** to rearrange panes and choose which tabs live where. If you ever get lost, reset to defaults.

---

## Quick Mental Model

- **Source:** Write your instructions.  
- **Console:** Run them (plus Terminal/Jobs for power moves).  
- **Environment:** Keeps track of what exists (with History/Connections/Build/VCS/Tutorial beside it).  
- **Output:** Displays what you need—files, plots, packages, help, web output, and slide decks.
