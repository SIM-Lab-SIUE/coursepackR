# Technical Guide: RStudio, Quarto, & Survey Design (Undergraduate)

This guide covers technical setup for your white paper and survey design best practices.

## RStudio & Quarto Setup
- Create a new RStudio Project by cloning your team GitHub repository
- Install necessary R packages:
  ```r
  install.packages(c("tidyverse", "rmarkdown", "quarto", "ggplot2", "readr"))
  ```
- Download any required style files (e.g., APA CSL) if needed
- Create your `white_paper.qmd` file using the template

## Survey Design
- Use clear, unbiased questions
- Pilot test your survey
- Get instructor approval before launching

For troubleshooting, see Quarto docs and ask your instructor.
