This page documents the functions students actually use. All commands assume you’re working inside an RStudio **Project**.

## At a glance

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `list_courses()` | Lists installed course IDs (e.g., `"mc451"`, `"mc501"`). |
| `list_weeks(course = NULL)` | Lists available week folders (e.g., `"week_01"`) for a course; if `NULL`, aggregates across courses. |
| `download_week(course, week, dest=".")` | Creates **`week_XX/`** under `dest` and copies that week’s files there. |
| `open_week(week, dest=".")` | Opens the local `week_XX/` folder in your file browser. |
| `mccourse_setup(ask = TRUE, pkgs = c(...))` | One-time helper: installs Quarto, TinyTeX (for PDF), and core CRAN packages if missing. |
| `mccourse_self_test()` | Prints the courses and weeks the package can see (sanity check). |
| `mccourse_update()` | Convenience to update **mccoursepack** to the latest GitHub build. |

## `list_courses()`

```r
list_courses()
````

Returns a character vector of course IDs (e.g., `"mc451"`, `"mc501"`). Empty if none are installed.

---

## `list_weeks(course = NULL)`

```r
list_weeks()           # across all installed courses
list_weeks("mc451")    # for a specific course
```

Returns folder names like `"week_01"`, `"week_02"`, … (empty if none).

---

## `download_week(course, week, dest = ".")`

```r
download_week("mc451", 1, dest = ".")   # also accepts "01" or "week_01"
```

* Creates `dest/week_01/` (or `week_XX/`) and copies that week’s files **into** the folder.
* Preserves subfolders.
* Empty templates (e.g., breaks) still create the folder but copy no files.

Returns (invisibly) a list: `list(dest, course, week, n_copied)`.

---

## `open_week(week, dest = ".")`

```r
open_week(1, dest = ".")
```

Opens `dest/week_01/` in your system file browser.

---

## `mccourse_setup(ask = TRUE, pkgs = c(...))`

```r
mccourse_setup()   # installs only what's missing
```

* Ensures **Quarto** is installed (engine for `.qmd`).
* Ensures **TinyTeX** (LaTeX) for **PDF** output.
* Installs a small set of **core CRAN packages** used across course materials.

---

## `mccourse_self_test()`

```r
mccourse_self_test()
```

Prints the courses found and the weeks available for each.

---

## `mccourse_update()`

```r
mccourse_update()
```

Updates **mccoursepack** to the latest version from GitHub (or use `pak::pak("SIM-Lab-SIUE/mccoursepack")` manually).

---

## Common patterns

* Open the **Project**, then run package commands.
* Render `.qmd` to PDF/HTML via Quarto. If PDF fails, run `mccourse_setup()` to install TinyTeX.
