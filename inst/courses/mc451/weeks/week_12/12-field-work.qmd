## Overview

This week is dedicated to field work — completing your data collection and ensuring your research meets ethical standards. There is no new chapter reading this week, giving you time to focus on your CITI certification and making progress on your project.

## Assignment: CITI Certification (25 pts)

3. Affiliate with **Southern Illinois University Edwardsville**
