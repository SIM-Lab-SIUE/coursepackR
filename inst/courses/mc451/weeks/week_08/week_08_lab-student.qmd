## Week 8: From Concepts to Code

**Textbook Chapter:** 8: The Art of Measurement\
**Dataset:** `w144_excerpt` (included in the `mccoursepack` package)\
**Core Functions/Packages:** `tidyverse` (for data manipulation and visualization)

### 1. Load the Data

We will use the `w144_excerpt` dataset to explore the concepts of measurement. Follow these steps:

``` r
# Load the required packages
library(mccoursepack)
library(tidyverse)

# Load the dataset
#> mccoursepack v0.1.0: Pew Research Center ATP W144 excerpt loaded. See ?w144_excerpt for details.
data(w144_excerpt)

# Confirm the dataset is loaded
head(w144_excerpt)
```

### 2. Explore Data Types

Understanding the structure of the dataset is the first step in conceptualizing and operationalizing variables.

``` r
# View the structure of the dataset
glimpse(w144_excerpt)

# Discuss: Which columns are numeric, character, or factor?
```

### 3. Summarize Numeric Variables

Summarizing numeric variables helps us identify continuous and categorical variables.

``` r
# Get an overview of numeric columns
summary(w144_excerpt)

# Discuss: Which variables are continuous? Which are categorical?
```

### 4. Convert and Explore Factors

Some variables, like `age_group` or `party_simple`, are stored as character or factor. Factors represent categorical data.

``` r
# Convert `age_group` to a factor (if not already)
w144_excerpt <- w144_excerpt %>%
  mutate(age_group = factor(age_group))

# Check the structure again
glimpse(w144_excerpt)

# Discuss: Why might we want to treat `age_group` as a factor?
```

### 5. Conceptualization and Operationalization

Let’s connect the dataset to the concepts from Chapter 8:

-   **Conceptualization:** Define what we mean by "social media engagement." For example, we might consider `platform_count` as an indicator of engagement.
-   **Operationalization:** Use the `platform_count` column to measure engagement.

``` r
# Example: Summarize platform counts
w144_excerpt %>%
  summarize(
    avg_platforms = mean(platform_count, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_platforms = min(platform_count, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_platforms = max(platform_count, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

### 6. Levels of Measurement

Identify the levels of measurement for key variables:

-   **Nominal:** `party_simple` (political party)
-   **Ordinal:** `age_group` (ordered categories)
-   **Interval/Ratio:** `platform_count` (count scale)

``` r
# Discuss: Why is `age_group` ordinal but `platform_count` is ratio?
```

### 7. Reliability and Validity

Reflect on the reliability and validity of the `platform_count` variable:

-   **Reliability:** Is the way platforms are counted consistent across respondents?
-   **Validity:** Does `platform_count` accurately measure social media engagement?

``` r
# Discuss: Why is it essential for a measure to be both reliable and valid?
```

### 8. Discussion

-   Why is `age_group` a factor but `platform_count` is numeric? How does this relate to measurement levels?
-   Think about a time you were measured or evaluated. Did the measure feel reliable and valid? Why or why not?
