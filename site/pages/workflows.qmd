title: "Weekly Workflows"
---

This page shows the rhythm you’ll use all term: update tools, pull materials, render, and commit/push. It’s intentionally week-neutral—no assignment details here, just mechanics.

---

## 0) Open your Project

Start inside your course **RStudio Project** (open the `.Rproj`). Projects keep paths stable and make everything else behave. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

---

## 1) Update the package (and your toolchain)

Do this at the top of the week (or whenever something looks out of date):

```r
install.packages("pak")                              # once per machine
pak::pak("SIM-Lab-SIUE/mccoursepack")               # update to latest
library(mccoursepack)                                # load this session

# If you haven't already done the one-time setup (or PDFs fail), run:
mccourse_setup()                                     # Quarto + TinyTeX + core pkgs
````

* `pak::pak()` installs from CRAN and GitHub quickly and reproducibly. ([R for Pakistan][1])
* **PDF rendering** requires a LaTeX engine; `mccourse_setup()` installs TinyTeX for you if needed. ([Quarto][2])

---

## 2) See what’s available

```r
list_courses()               # e.g., "mc451", "mc501"
list_weeks("mc451")          # returns "week_01", "week_02", ...
```

You’ll copy one of these week folders into your Project in the next step.

---

## 3) Copy materials into your Project

```r
# Replace N with the week number you need (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...)
download_week("mc451", N, dest = ".")   # creates ./week_0N/ and copies files
open_week(N, dest = ".")                # (optional) opens the folder in your file browser
```

Open the `.qmd` inside `week_0N/` and click **Render**. Our templates default to **PDF first**; HTML is available too. Quarto builds the document according to the YAML at the top of the file. ([Quarto][3])

---

## 4) Version your work with Git (RStudio Git pane)

Typical loop:

1. **Pull** (get changes from GitHub)
2. **Stage** the files you changed
3. **Commit** with a short message
4. **Push** to GitHub

If you prefer the command line:

```bash
git pull
git add -A
git commit -m "Update journal and render outputs"
git push
```

That “stage → commit → push” sequence is the canonical Git workflow, and RStudio mirrors it in the Git pane. ([GitHub Resources][4], [r-bio.github.io][5])

---

## 5) Keep the docs site up to date (maintainers only)

If you’re editing the Quarto **website** under `site/`, the flow is:

```bash
# from repo root in VS Code or a terminal
quarto preview site     # local live preview
# edit .qmd files...
git add -A
git commit -m "docs: expand troubleshooting & reference"
git push
```

A GitHub Actions workflow renders the site and publishes it to Pages automatically; you set this once and it runs on every push. ([Quarto][6], [GitHub][7])

---

## Quick checklist (each week)

* [ ] Open the **Project** (paths correct) ([Tidyverse][8])
* [ ] `pak::pak("SIM-Lab-SIUE/mccoursepack")` (updated tools) ([R for Pakistan][1])
* [ ] `download_week("mc451", N, dest = ".")` (materials in place)
* [ ] Render `.qmd` (PDF/HTML via Quarto) ([Quarto][3])
* [ ] Stage → Commit → Push (history saved online) ([GitHub Resources][4])

---

## Common speed bumps

* **PDF errors** → run `mccourse_setup()` to install TinyTeX (LaTeX). ([Quarto][2])
* **Git pane missing** → enable Git for the Project (Project Options → Git/SVN). ([GitHub Resources][4])
* **Website renders too much** → scope the Quarto project with a `project.render` whitelist under `site/_quarto.yml`. ([Quarto][6])

```

**Why these references?** Project-oriented work keeps paths sane; `pak` is the recommended fast installer (including GitHub); Quarto’s PDF output depends on a TeX engine; RStudio’s Git pane implements the standard stage→commit→push flow; and Quarto + GitHub Pages via Actions is the supported publishing path. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
