## Installing on Windows

Follow these steps in order.

### 1. Install R

1.  Go to the [CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network)](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/).
2.  Click the large **"Download R-X.X.X for Windows"** link at the top of the page.
3.  Run the downloaded installer (`.exe` file).
4.  Accept all the default settings during installation. Click "Next" until it's finished.

### 2. Install RStudio

1.  Go to the [Posit website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
2.  Click the "Download RStudio Desktop" button. The site should automatically detect you are on Windows.
3.  Run the downloaded installer.
4.  Accept all the default settings.

### 3. Install Git

1.  Go to the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2.  Click the "Windows" link to download the installer.
3.  Run the installer. This one has many screens, but you can safely **accept all the default options**. The most important thing is to ensure that Git is added to your system's PATH, which is the default behavior.

## Installing on macOS

Follow these steps in order.

### 1. Install R

1.  Go to the [CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network)](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/).
2.  Look for the "Latest release" section. Download the package (`.pkg` file) that matches your Mac's processor (Apple Silicon "M1/M2/M3" or Intel). If you're unsure, click the Apple menu → "About This Mac" to check.
3.  Run the downloaded installer. Accept all default settings.

### 2. Install RStudio

1.  Go to the [Posit website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
2.  Click the "Download RStudio Desktop" button. The site should automatically detect you are on macOS.
3.  This will download a `.dmg` file. Open it.
4.  A new window will appear. Drag the RStudio icon into the Applications folder icon.
5.  The first time you open RStudio, you may get a security warning. Click "Open" to proceed.

### 3. Install Git

macOS comes with Git pre-installed. However, it's often best to install a newer version using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), a package manager for macOS.

1.  **Install Homebrew (if you don't have it):** Open the **Terminal** app (you can find it in Applications/Utilities) and paste the following command, then press Enter:
    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```
2.  **Install Git:** Once Homebrew is installed, run the following command in the Terminal:
    ```bash
    brew install git
    ```
This ensures you have an up-to-date version of Git.
