title: "Weekly Workflows"
---

This page shows the rhythm you’ll use all term: update tools, pull materials, render, and commit/push. It’s intentionally week-neutral—no assignment details here, just mechanics.

---

## 0) Open your Project

Start inside your course **RStudio Project** (open the `.Rproj`). Projects keep paths stable and make everything else behave.

---

## 1) Update the package (and your toolchain)

```r
install.packages("pak")                              # once per machine
pak::pak("SIM-Lab-SIUE/mccoursepack")               # update to latest
library(mccoursepack)                                # load this session

# If you haven't already done the one-time setup (or PDFs fail), run:
mccourse_setup()                                     # Quarto + TinyTeX + core pkgs
````

---

## 2) See what’s available

```r
list_courses()               # e.g., "mc451", "mc501"
list_weeks("mc451")          # "week_01", "week_02", ...
```

---

## 3) Copy materials into your Project

```r
# Replace N with the week number you need (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...)
download_week("mc451", N, dest = ".")   # creates ./week_0N/ and copies files
open_week(N, dest = ".")                # optional: opens the folder
```

Open the `.qmd` inside `week_0N/` and click **Render**. Our templates default to **PDF first**; HTML is available too.

---

## 4) Version your work with Git (RStudio Git pane)

1. **Pull** (get changes from GitHub)
2. **Stage** the files you changed
3. **Commit** with a short message
4. **Push** to GitHub

Command line:

```bash
git pull
git add -A
git commit -m "Update journal and render outputs"
git push
```

---

## 5) Keep the docs site up to date (maintainers only)

If you’re editing the Quarto **website** under `site/`:

```bash
# from repo root
quarto preview site     # local live preview
# edit .qmd files...
git add -A
git commit -m "docs: expand troubleshooting & reference"
git push
```

A GitHub Actions workflow renders the site and publishes it to Pages automatically.

## Quick checklist (each week)

* [ ] Open the **Project**
* [ ] `pak::pak("SIM-Lab-SIUE/mccoursepack")`
* [ ] `download_week("mc451", N, dest = ".")`
* [ ] Render `.qmd` (PDF/HTML via Quarto)
* [ ] Stage → Commit → Push
