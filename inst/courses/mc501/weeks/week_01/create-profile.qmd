title: "Set Up Your GitHub Profile README (plus Profile Photo)"
---

This guide shows a brand-new GitHub user how to (1) create the special **profile README** that appears at the top of their profile page and (2) set a **profile photo** (avatar). Everything happens in the web browser—no command line required.

---

## 0) Before you start

- Create a GitHub account: <https://github.com/join>  
- Sign in at <https://github.com>

If you’re new to Markdown (the simple formatting used on GitHub), skim:  
**Basic writing and formatting** → <https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax>

---

## 1) Make the special “profile” repository

GitHub shows a README on your profile **when you create a public repository whose name exactly matches your GitHub username**.

1. Click the **+** button (top-right) → **New repository**.  
2. **Repository name**: type your exact GitHub username (e.g., if your username is `octocat`, then the repo name must be `octocat`).  
3. Choose **Public**.  
4. Check **Add a README file**.  
5. Click **Create repository**.

> If the README doesn’t appear on your profile later, double-check: the repo name matches your username exactly, it’s **public**, and the file is named **`README.md`** at the **root** of that repo.

---

## 2) Edit your README in the browser

1. In your new repo, click **README.md**.  
2. Click the **pencil** icon (**Edit this file**).  
3. Paste this starter content and customize:

```md
# Welcome — I'm YOUR NAME 👋

- 🎓 Program / Role:
- 📍 Location:
- 📫 Contact: EMAIL or LINKS
- 🌱 I’m learning / interested in: TOPICS

## About Me

Write a brief bio in 3–4 sentences. Add a few bullets for highlights.

## Links

- Website/Portfolio: https://example.com
- LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/in/yourhandle
- Twitter/X: https://x.com/yourhandle
````

4. At the bottom, write a short message like **Add profile README** and click **Commit changes**.
5. Visit your profile page: `https://github.com/<your-username>` — your README should now appear at the top.

---

## 3) Set your GitHub **profile photo** (avatar)

This is the round picture shown next to your name across GitHub.

1. Go to **Settings**: click your avatar (top-right) → **Settings**.
2. Under **Public profile**, click **Edit** next to **Profile picture**.
3. Click **Upload a photo…**, choose a picture, and **Upload**.
4. Use the crop tool if needed, then click **Set new profile picture**.

> Tip: You can change it any time from the same page. If your email is linked to **Gravatar**, the **Revert** option may show “Revert to Gravatar.”

---

## 4) Polish your README (optional)

Common sections people add:

* **About Me** — short bio in plain English
* **What I’m working on / learning** — 2–4 bullets
* **Links** — website, LinkedIn, etc.
* **Contact** — best way to reach you

Use the **Preview** tab while editing to see how your Markdown will render.

---

## 5) Troubleshooting

* **My README isn’t showing on my profile**

  * The repository name must exactly match your **username**, and it must be **public**.
  * The file must be named **`README.md`** and live in the **root** of that repo.
  * Give the page a quick refresh after committing.

* **My profile photo didn’t update**

  * Make sure you clicked **Set new profile picture** after cropping. Refresh your profile page; caching can delay updates for a minute.
