# Using Zotero with RStudio

Zotero is a free, open-source reference manager that helps you collect, organize, cite, and share research. Integrating Zotero with RStudio can streamline your academic writing workflow, especially when using Quarto or R Markdown documents.

## 1. Install Zotero
- Download Zotero from [zotero.org](https://www.zotero.org/).
- Install the Zotero Connector for your web browser to easily save references.

## 2. Organize Your References
- Use Zotero to collect and organize references into collections.
- Attach PDFs and notes to your references for easy access.

## 3. Export References for RStudio
- **BibTeX Export:**
    - Right-click a collection or selected items in Zotero.
    - Choose `Export Collection...` or `Export Items...`.
    - Select `BibTeX` as the format and save the `.bib` file.
- **Better BibTeX Plugin:**
    - Install the [Better BibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) plugin for advanced citation key management and automatic export.

## 4. Use References in RStudio (Quarto/R Markdown)
- Place your exported `.bib` file in your project directory (e.g., `references.bib`).
- In your Quarto or R Markdown document YAML header, add:

```yaml
bibliography: references.bib
csl: apa.csl  # Optional: for citation style
```

- Cite references in your text using `@citationkey` (e.g., `@smith2020`).

## 5. Render Your Document
- Knit or render your document in RStudio. Citations and bibliography will be formatted automatically.

## 6. Tips
- Keep your `.bib` file updated as you add new references.
- Use the Better BibTeX auto-export feature to keep your bibliography in sync.
- Explore citation styles by downloading `.csl` files from [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles).
