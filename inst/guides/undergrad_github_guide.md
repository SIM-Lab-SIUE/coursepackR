# Undergraduate Group White Paper: GitHub Guide

This guide covers all steps for using GitHub in your group white paper project, including setup, collaboration, and submission.

## Why Use GitHub?
- Version control for your team
- Cloud backup
- Collaboration: All team members can work on the same project
- Submission: Required for your final project

## Steps
1. One team member creates a private repository on GitHub (e.g., `white-paper-f24`).
2. Add a README file.
3. All team members: Clone the repository to your local RStudio Projects.
4. Commit and push changes regularly; communicate with your team to avoid conflicts.
5. Submit your GitHub link as your final deliverable.
