# Graduate Research Paper: Project Overview

This is an individual project requiring you to produce a professional, APA-style research paper of approximately **6,000–8,000 words**. You will identify a mass communications problem, conduct a comprehensive review of the academic literature, and execute original survey research (Goal: 100+ responses) to generate new insights.

The entire project will be built in **RStudio using Quarto**, and your submission will be twofold: the final manuscript (PDF) on Blackboard and the complete RProject via GitHub.

### **Core Requirements**

-   **Project:** Individual (no teams).

-   **Length:** 6,000–8,000 words (excluding references, tables, and appendices).

-   **Sources:** 15-20 academic, peer-reviewed citations.

-   **Research:** One original survey (N=100 goal) or an alternative, pre-approved methodology.

-   **Questions:** Exactly two (2) Research Questions (RQs) and/or Hypotheses (RHs).

-   **Analysis:** All data must be analyzed using RStudio.

-   **Visuals:** At least two (2) data visualizations (e.g., tables, figures) created in R and formatted for APA style.

-   **Format:** APA 7th Edition style, written in a Quarto (`.qmd`) file.

-   **Style:** Must meet professional and academic standards.

### **Final Deliverables**

1.  **Blackboard Submission:** The final, rendered `research_paper.pdf` manuscript.

2.  **GitHub Submission:** A link to your private GitHub repository, which must contain:

    -   `research_paper.qmd`: Your main Quarto file.

    -   `references.bib`: Your bibliography file.

    -   `README.md`: A brief abstract of your project.

    -   A `/data` folder containing your raw `survey_data.csv`.

    -   An `/output` folder containing the final rendered `research_paper.pdf`.

### **Master Project Checklist**

Use this checklist to track your progress.

#### **Phase 1: Setup & Planning (Week 1-2)**

-   \[ \] Finalize your research topic.

-   \[ \] Get your topic and RQs/RHs approved by your instructor.

-   \[ \] Create your private GitHub repository (see `grad_github_guide.md`).

-   \[ \] Clone the repository to your local machine via RStudio.

-   \[ \] Set up your RStudio Project and main `research_paper.qmd` file (see `grad_technical_guide.md`).

-   \[ \] Set up your Zotero library and link your `references.bib` file (see `grad_zotero_guide.md`).

#### **Phase 2: Research & Data Collection (Week 3-5)**

-   \[ \] Conduct your literature review, adding 15-20 sources to Zotero.

-   \[ \] Write the draft of your Introduction & Literature Review.

-   \[ \] Design your survey (see `grad_technical_guide.md` for best practices).

-   \[ \] **Ethics Check:** Get your survey questions approved by your instructor before launching.

-   \[ \] Launch your survey and collect data (Goal: 100+ responses).

-   \[ \] Close the survey and export the data as `survey_data_raw.csv`.

-   \[ \] Add the raw data file to your `/data` folder and push to GitHub.

#### **Phase 3: Analysis & Writing (Week 6-8)**

-   \[ \] Write the `Method` section in APA style.

-   \[ \] Clean your data using an R script (or a code chunk in your `.qmd`).

-   \[ \] Analyze your data in R to answer your 2 RQs/RHs (e.g., correlations, t-tests, ANOVA).

-   \[ \] Create at least 2 high-quality, APA-formatted visualizations in R.

-   \[ \] Write the `Results` section, embedding your R output and visuals.

-   \[ \] Write the `Discussion` section, connecting your results to your lit review and theory.

#### **Phase 4: Finalization (Week 9-10)**

-   \[ \] Write the `Abstract`, `Conclusion`, and format the `References` page.

-   \[ \] Read and edit the entire paper for clarity, style, and APA formatting.

-   \[ \] Check that all 15-20 sources are cited correctly.

-   \[ \] Check that your R code runs and your visualizations render properly.

-   \[ \] Render your final `research_paper.pdf` and add it to the `/output` folder.

-   \[ \] Update your `README.md` with your final abstract.

-   \[ \] Push all final changes to GitHub.

-   \[ \] **Submit the `research_paper.pdf` to Blackboard.**

-   \[ \] **Submit your GitHub repository link.**
