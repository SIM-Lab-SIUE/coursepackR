R is a free, open-source language for **data manipulation, analysis, and visualization**. RStudio is the **IDE** (workbench) that makes R friendlier and faster. Together they give you a modern workflow for **reproducible research** in mass communication.

::: tip
Use R for the statistics and graphics; use **RStudio** to write code, render reports, manage files, and keep projects organized.

## What is R?

- A programming language for statistics and data work (from simple summaries to machine learning).
- Script-based: you **write code** that documents exactly what you did—great for transparency and reuse.
- Superpowers via **packages** (e.g., `tidyverse` for wrangling, `ggplot2` for visualization).

**Why it matters here:** You’ll analyze surveys, scrape or analyze social media, and make publication-quality figures—repeatably.

---

## What is RStudio?

RStudio (by Posit) is the **integrated development environment** for R:

- **Source editor** with syntax highlighting and autocomplete
- **Console** for running code
- **Environment** to inspect objects/datasets
- **Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer** to manage outputs and docs
- Tight integration with **Quarto** (dynamic documents) and **Git**

**Outcome:** faster iteration, cleaner organization, and easier collaboration.

## Why Use R + RStudio?

### Open Source
Free to install and extend. A huge community keeps adding new methods without license fees.

### Analysis & Visualization
From descriptive stats to regression and beyond in one place; `ggplot2` produces clear, customizable graphics.

### Reproducible Research
Quarto documents combine **text + code + output** in one file. Re-render to update everything automatically.

### Flexible & Extensible
Thousands of packages for text analysis, social media data, networks, etc. Write your own functions when needed.

## Install R and RStudio

### 1) Install R
1. Go to <https://cran.r-project.org/>
2. Choose your OS (Windows / macOS / Linux) and install.

### 2) Install RStudio
1. Go to <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>
2. Download **RStudio Desktop (free)** for your OS and install.

::: tip
Install **R first**, then **RStudio**. RStudio detects your R installation at launch.

## Meet the RStudio Interface (Four Panes)

- **Source (top-left):** write/edit scripts (`.R`) and Quarto files (`.qmd`).
- **Console (bottom-left):** run code interactively; see results/errors.
- **Environment (top-right):** objects in memory (data frames, models, etc.).
- **Output (bottom-right):** Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer (for HTML/Shiny/Quarto previews).

> For a deeper tour, see **RStudio’s Four Panes** in this section.

## Start a New Project

Projects keep everything for one assignment/research task in one folder.

1. **File → New Project…**
2. Choose **New Directory → New Project** (or link an existing folder).
3. Name it and create.

Benefits: consistent working directory, clean file paths, and fewer “where did that file go?” moments. Git can be enabled during setup for version control.

## File Management Essentials

### R Script vs. R Markdown / Quarto
- **R Script (`.R`)**: pure code; great for fast analysis.
- **Quarto (`.qmd`)**: prose + code + output → renders to HTML/PDF/Word for reports.

```r
# R Script example
summary(cars)
plot(cars)
````

```{r}
# Quarto example chunk (runs when you render the doc)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(cars, aes(speed, dist)) + geom_point()
```

### CSV vs. Excel

* Prefer **CSV** for clean, durable data.
* Use **Excel** only when collaborators require it or you genuinely need multiple sheets.

### Suggested subfolders

```
data/     # raw and cleaned datasets
scripts/  # R scripts
reports/  # .qmd / rendered outputs
output/   # figures, tables, exports
```

---

## Package Management

### Install once, load each session

```r
install.packages("ggplot2")  # once
library(ggplot2)             # each new R session
```

### Common packages for this course

* **`tidyverse`**: wrangling + plotting
* **`ggplot2`**: visualization
* **`dplyr`**: data manipulation
* **`quanteda` / `tm`**: text analysis
* **`rtweet`**: Twitter/X data (when permitted)

Update periodically:

```r
update.packages(ask = FALSE)
```

## Basics of R (Quick Start)

### Arithmetic

```r
5 + 3     # 8
5 - 3     # 2
5 * 3     # 15
5 / 3     # 1.6667
5 ^ 3     # 125
5 %% 3    # 2 (modulus)
```

### Variables

```r
x <- 10          # preferred assignment in R
y = 20           # also works
name <- "Alex"
```

### Functions

```r
sum(1, 2, 3)            # 6
mean(c(1, 2, 3, 4))     # 2.5
sqrt(16)                # 4
```

---

## Commenting & Organizing Code

### Comments

```r
# This is a comment for humans
age <- c(18, 23, 21, 30)   # vector of ages
```

### Sections

```r
# =========================
# Section: Data Preparation
# =========================
```

In Quarto, use markdown headings to structure your narrative:

```markdown
## Data Preparation

Here we clean variables and handle missing values.
```

::: tip
Keep code tidy: consistent indentation, small steps, and meaningful names. Your future self (and collaborators) will thank you.
:::

---

## First Run: Your Hello World

```r
print("Hello, World!")
```

Open a Quarto file and add a code chunk:

````
```{r}
print("Hello, World from Quarto!")
```
````

Render the document to see executable output embedded in your report.

## Next Steps

* Install the **course package** and pull your **Journal** scaffold.
* Read **RStudio’s Four Panes** and **Global Options** pages to customize your workspace.
* Commit your project to **GitHub** and set your **Profile README**.
