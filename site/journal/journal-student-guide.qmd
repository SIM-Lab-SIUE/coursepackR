Start with the **Student Guide** below.

Your **course journal** is a Quarto **book**. Each **week** has a chapter with **three prompts**--you answer **one**.  
Word ranges are enforced when you render:

- **MC 451:** **250-300** words  
- **MC 501:** **450-500** words

---

## Step 1 -- Create a new RStudio Project

1. Open **RStudio** -> **File -> New Project -> New Directory -> New Project**.  
2. Choose a location (e.g., `Documents/MC451/`) and name it (e.g., `journal_project`).

---

## Step 2 -- Install and load the course package

In the **Console**:

```r
pak::pak("SIM-Lab-SIUE/mccoursepack")
library(mccoursepack)
````

If prompted, restart R after installation.

---

## Step 3 -- Download your starter journal

Run:

```r
download_journal("mc451", dest = ".")   # or "mc501"
```

This populates your project's main folder with the complete journal structure.

---

## Step 4 -- Load the Journal Helper Function

Before you can add a new entry, you need to load the helper function that creates the file for you.

1.  In the **Files** pane (bottom-right), navigate into the `scripts` folder.
2.  Click on the file `new_journal_entry.R` to open it in the editor.
3.  Click the **Source** button in the top-right corner of the editor pane.

This loads the `new_journal_entry()` function into your R environment for the current session.

---

## Step 5 -- Add a new week chapter

In the **Console** pane at the bottom-left, run:

```r
# Pick your week number (2-14). Example:
new_journal_entry(week = 3)
```

**FIGURE**
![Entries Stored by Date of Creation.](../images/entries.png "Entries Saved by Date of Creation"){width=50%; fig-align="center"}

What happens:

1. A new chapter is created and named with **today's date**: `entries/YYYY-MM-DD.qmd`.
2. The **three prompts for that week** are inserted.
3. The correct **word range** for your course is set.
4. `_quarto.yml` is **automatically updated** to add the new chapter to the book's table of contents.


**FIGURE**
![Console showing `new_journal_entry(week = 3)` and "Created: entries/YYYY-MM-DD.qmd.](../images/journal-week.png "Choosing Week for Journal"){width=50%; fig-align="center"}

> **Troubleshooting:** If you run the command twice **on the same day**, the file will be overwritten (same date name). If you need to keep both, rename the first file (e.g., `2025-09-03b.qmd`) before running again.

---

## Step 6 -- Handling Multiple Entries on the Same Day

The `new_journal_entry()` function names files by date (e.g., `2025-09-04.qmd`). If you want to write a second entry on the same day for a different week's prompt, you should rename the first file to something more descriptive before creating the new one.

For example, you could rename `entries/2025-09-04.qmd` to `entries/2025-09-04-week3.qmd`.

The good news is that you **do not need to manually edit `_quarto.yml`**. The journal is set up to automatically find all `.qmd` files in the `entries/` directory every time you render it. This means you can add, remove, or rename your entry files, and the book will always build correctly.

---

## Step 7 -- Choose your prompt, then write

Open the new file (e.g., `entries/2025-09-03.qmd`). You'll see **Choose one prompt** first, then **Response**.

**Keep ONE prompt and delete the other two** in the *Choose one prompt* section. Then write your answer **only** inside the **Response** block.

### Choose **one** prompt to answer

> **Prompt A:** `r params$p1`
> **Prompt B:** `r params$p2`
> **Prompt C:** `r params$p3`

### Response

<!-- RESPONSE-START -->

*Write your answer to **one** of the prompts here. Do not write anything else in this chapter.*

<!-- RESPONSE-END -->

Stay in range:

* **MC 451:** 250-300 words
* **MC 501:** 450-500 words

## Step 8 -- Render the **entire** journal (unified output)

You have two equivalent options. Use **one** of them:

**A) Click Render on `index.qmd`**

* In the Files pane, click on `index.qmd`.
* Click the **Render** button in the editor toolbar.

**B) Use the Console**

```bash
# Run from the project's root directory
quarto render
```

Outputs are in the `_book/` directory:

* An **HTML** book (always, multi-page site with navigation = unified entity).
* **PDF/EPUB** if you have TinyTeX installed.

If a PDF fails to build, run:

```r
quarto install tinytex
# or
mccourse_setup()
```

> **Tip:** Rendering a single chapter file will **not** produce the unified journal. Always render **`index.qmd`** (or run `quarto render`) to build the whole book.



---

## Step 9 — Submit via GitHub

When you add or edit a chapter, **two files are modified**:

1. The new chapter file: `entries/YYYY-MM-DD.qmd`
2. The book's table of contents: `_quarto.yml` (updated automatically by the pre-render script)

In RStudio:

1. Open the **Git** pane.
2. **Stage** both changed files.
3. Add a commit message (e.g., “Week 3 journal entry”).
4. **Commit** and **Push**.

> If you forget to commit the changes to `_quarto.yml`, your new chapter won’t appear in the published book.

## FAQ

**It didn’t ask me for the week number. Is that okay?**
Yes. In RStudio you usually call the function directly: `new_journal_entry(week = 5)`.

**My word count says “Out of range.”**
Edit until you are within the range for your course.

**The new chapter doesn’t appear in the rendered book.**
Be sure you rendered the **whole book** (Render `index.qmd` or run `quarto render` from the project root). The pre-render script automatically updates the chapter list, but only when the entire book is rendered. Also, make sure you have committed **both** the new entry file and the automatically modified `_quarto.yml`.

**Can I revise later?**
Yes. Edit the same `entries/YYYY-MM-DD.qmd`, then commit and push again.

## Weekly checklist (quick self-audit)

* [ ] I created/updated a chapter for **this week** using `new_journal_entry(week = N)`.
* [ ] I sourced the `new_journal_entry.R` script first.
* [ ] I kept **one** prompt and deleted the other **two**.
* [ ] I wrote my answer **inside the Response block** only.
* [ ] My word count is **in range**.
* [ ] I **rendered the whole book** by rendering `index.qmd` (or running `quarto render`).
* [ ] I **staged, committed, and pushed** my new/modified entry file(s) and the updated `_quarto.yml`.
