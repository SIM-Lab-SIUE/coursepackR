# Guide: Using GitHub for Your Research Project

Even for a solo project, using Git and GitHub is a professional best practice. It provides version control (a "time machine" for your work), a secure cloud backup, and a simple way to submit your project.

### **Why Use GitHub for a Solo Project?**

-   **Version Control:** You can "commit" (save) snapshots of your project. If you break your code or delete a section by accident, you can easily "roll back" to a previous version.

-   **Cloud Backup:** Your project lives on your computer *and* on GitHub. If your computer fails, your work is not lost.

-   **Portability:** You can "clone" your project onto any computer, work on it, and "push" your changes back to the cloud.

-   **Submission:** It's how you will turn in your RProject as required.

### **Step 1: Create the GitHub Repository**

1.  Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/ "null").

2.  Create a new **private** repository. Name it clearly (e.g., `grad-research-paper-f24`).

3.  **IMPORTANT:** Check the box to **"Add a README file"**.

4.  (You do not need to add collaborators for this project).

### **Step 2: Clone the Repository to RStudio**

This creates a local copy of the project on your computer.

1.  Go to the repository's main page on GitHub.

2.  Click the green `<> Code` button.

3.  Copy the `HTTPS` URL.

4.  In RStudio, go to `File` \> `New Project...` \> `Version Control` \> `Git`.

5.  Paste the URL into the `Repository URL` field.

6.  Choose a location on your computer for the project to live.

7.  Click "Create Project." RStudio will restart and open your new project.

### **Step 3: The Solo Workflow (Pull, Edit, Commit, Push)**

Follow this cycle to keep your local files and your cloud backup in sync.

#### **A. PULL (When you start work)**

*Before you start working,* it's a good habit to "pull." This is crucial if you ever work from two different computers (e.g., a desktop and a laptop).

1.  Open your RStudio project.

2.  Go to the **`Git`** tab in the top-right pane.

3.  Click the **`Pull`** button (blue down-arrow). This fetches the latest version from GitHub.

#### **B. EDIT (Do your work)**

-   Now you can safely work on your files (e.g., write in the `.qmd` file, add R code).

#### **C. COMMIT (Save a snapshot)**

When you've finished a chunk of work (or at the end of the day), you "commit" your changes.

1.  Go to the **`Git`** tab.

2.  Check the boxes next to the files you've changed.

3.  Click **`Commit`**.

4.  A new window will open. In the `Commit message` box, write a *brief* description of what you did (e.g., "Finished results section" or "Fixed ggplot2 labels").

5.  Click **`Commit`**.

#### **D. PUSH (Back up to the cloud)**

Your "commit" is still only on your computer. "Pushing" sends it to GitHub. Do this at the end of every work session.

1.  After committing, click the **`Push`** button (green up-arrow) on the `Git` tab.

2.  Your changes are now safely backed up on GitHub.

**Your Cycle:** `Pull` (to sync) -\> `Edit` -\> `Commit` (to save) -\> `Push` (to back up).

### **Step 4: The Final Repository Structure**

Your final repository *must* be organized.

```         
/your-project-repository ├── research_paper.qmd    <-- Your main Quarto file ├── references.bib        <-- Your bibliography file ├── apa.csl               <-- Your APA 7 style file (see technical_guide) ├── README.md             <-- A brief abstract of your project │ ├── /data │   ├── survey_data_raw.csv   <-- The raw data from your survey │ ├── /output │   └── research_paper.pdf    <-- The final, rendered PDF │ └── (Your RStudio .Rproj file will also be here)
