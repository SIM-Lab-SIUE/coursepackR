# Mass Communications White Paper: Project Overview

This project requires your 2-3 person team to produce a professional, data-driven white paper of approximately **3,000-4,000 words**. You will identify a mass communications problem, review existing academic literature, and conduct your own original survey research (Goal: 100+ responses) to propose new insights or solutions.

The entire project will be built in **RStudio using Quarto** and submitted as a **GitHub repository**.

### **Core Requirements**

-   **Team:** 2-3 members.

-   **Length:** 3,000-4,000 words.

-   **Sources:** 10-12 academic citations.

-   **Research:** One original survey (N=100 goal).

-   **Questions:** Exactly two (2) Research Questions (RQs) and/or Hypotheses (RHs).

-   **Analysis:** All data must be analyzed using RStudio.

-   **Visuals:** At least two (2) data visualizations created in R (e.g., with `ggplot2`).

-   **Format:** Written in a Quarto (`.qmd`) file.

-   **Style:** Must meet professional journalistic standards (clear, direct, and engaging).

### **Final Deliverables**

Your submission will be a single link to your team's GitHub repository, which must contain:

1.  `white_paper.qmd`: Your main Quarto file with all text, code, and visualizations.

2.  `references.bib`: Your bibliography file.

3.  `README.md`: A brief description of your project and its findings.

4.  A `/data` folder containing your raw `survey_data.csv`.

5.  An `/output` folder containing the final rendered `white_paper.pdf`.

### **Master Project Checklist**

Use this checklist to track your progress from start to finish.

#### **Phase 1: Setup & Planning**

-   [ ] Form your 2-3 person team.

-   [ ] Brainstorm 2-3 potential topics.

-   [ ] Get your final topic and RQs/RHs approved by your instructor.

-   [ ] Create your team's GitHub repository (see `github_guide.md`).

-   [ ] All members: Clone the repository to your local machines.

-   [ ] Set up your RStudio Project and main `white_paper.qmd` file (see `technical_guide.md`).

-   [ ] Set up your team's Zotero group library and link your `references.bib` file (see `zotero_guide.md`).

#### **Phase 2: Research & Data Collection**

-   [ ] Conduct your literature review, adding 10-12 sources to Zotero.

-   [ ] Write the first draft of your Introduction & Literature Review sections.

-   [ ] Design your survey (see `technical_guide.md` for best practices).

-   [ ] **Ethics Check:** Get your survey questions approved by your instructor before launching.

-   [ ] Launch your survey and collect data (Goal: 100+ responses).

-   [ ] Close the survey and export the data as `survey_data_raw.csv`.

-   [ ] Add the raw data file to your `/data` folder in the GitHub repo.

#### **Phase 3: Analysis & Writing**

-   [ ] Write the `Methodology` section.

-   [ ] Clean your data using an R script (or a code chunk in your `.qmd`).

-   [ ] Analyze your data in R to answer your 2 RQs/RHs.

-   [ ] Create at least 2 high-quality visualizations in R (`ggplot2`).

-   [ ] Write the `Results` section, embedding your R output and visualizations.

-   [ ] Write the `Discussion` section, connecting your results back to your lit review.

-   [ ] Write the `Conclusion & Recommendations` section.

#### **Phase 4: Finalization**

-   [ ] All team members: Read and edit the entire paper for clarity, style, and flow.

-   [ ] Check that all 10-12 sources are cited correctly.

-   [ ] Check that your R code runs and your visualizations render properly.

-   [ ] Render your final `white_paper.pdf` and add it to the `/output` folder.

-   [ ] Update your `README.md` with a final abstract/summary.

-   [ ] Push all final changes to GitHub.

-   [ ] Submit your GitHub repository link.
