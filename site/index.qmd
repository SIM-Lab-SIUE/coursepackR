# mccoursepack

A beginner-friendly guide to the tools we use in MC 451/501 and how to work with the **mccoursepack** R package. If you’re brand new, read this page once, then hop to **Getting Started** in the sidebar.

---

## What this site covers

- **R & RStudio** basics (how to work inside a Project)
- **Git & GitHub** (saving, versioning, pushing your work)
- **Quarto** (rendering `.qmd` to PDF/HTML)
- The **mccoursepack** functions you’ll use every week

Each topic has a short, task-oriented page. No assignment details live here—this is your *reference manual*.

## Quick start: 5 steps

1. **Open RStudio** and create (or open) a Project for this course (e.g., `Documents/MC451`).
2. **Install and load** the course package:
   ```r
   install.packages("pak")
   pak::pak("SIM-Lab-SIUE/mccoursepack")
   library(mccoursepack)
````

3. **Run the one-time setup** (Quarto, TinyTeX for PDFs, and core R packages):

   ```r
   mccourse_setup()
   ```
4. **See what’s available**:

   ```r
   list_courses()            # e.g., "mc451", "mc501"
   list_weeks("mc451")       # e.g., "week_01", "week_02", ...
   ```
5. **Copy a week’s scaffold** into your Project folder (creates `week_XX/`):

   ```r
   download_week("mc451", 1, dest = ".")  # pick any available week
   ```

   Open the `.qmd` inside that `week_XX/` folder and **Render**. (Our templates default to **PDF first**; HTML is available too.)

## Core commands (cheat sheet)

```r
# Load the package each new R session
library(mccoursepack)

# Discover what you can pull
list_courses()
list_weeks("mc451")          # replace with your course id

# Copy materials into your Project
download_week("mc451", 1, dest = ".")

# Open the local folder for a given week in your file browser
open_week(1, dest = ".")

# One-time environment setup (Quarto, TinyTeX, core pkgs)
mccourse_setup()

# Sanity check: what does the package see installed?
mccourse_self_test()
```

## How this site is organized

* **Getting Started** — first-time install + Project setup
* **R & RStudio** — the everyday workflow inside a Project
* **Git & GitHub** — commit/push without drama
* **Quarto** — render `.qmd` to PDF/HTML and fix common hiccups
* **Workflows** — repeatable patterns (update package, pull new materials, render, commit)
* **Troubleshooting** — fast fixes for the usual suspects
* **Reference** — short docs for each exported function

Use the search box in the sidebar to jump straight to what you need.

## System notes (read once)

* Work **inside an RStudio Project** so file paths “just work.”
* **Quarto** renders `.qmd` files. **PDF output** requires a LaTeX engine; `mccourse_setup()` offers to install **TinyTeX** if you don’t have one.
* Keep your course folder path short (especially on Windows) to avoid path-length issues.

---

## When you’re stuck

Open **Troubleshooting** in the sidebar and try the top fixes. If you’re still blocked, include in your help request:

* your OS, R, and RStudio versions,
* the exact code you ran,
* the full error message, and
* a quick screenshot of your folder layout if paths might be involved.

```
