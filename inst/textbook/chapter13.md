Numbers alone don't tell stories. Tables communicate precisely but demand effort from readers. A correlation coefficient of r = 0.67 is meaningful if you understand statistics, but it's abstract. Most people—including many researchers—struggle to intuit what that number means in practice.

Visualization makes patterns visible.

A well-designed chart can reveal relationships, outliers, and trends that would take paragraphs to describe in text. It can make a skeptical reader believe your finding. It can turn an abstract statistical claim into something concrete and comprehensible.

But visualization is also dangerous. Bad charts mislead. Poorly chosen visualizations obscure rather than illuminate. A pie chart with twelve slices communicates nothing. A scatterplot with no labels is useless. A bar chart that doesn't start at zero exaggerates differences.

This chapter teaches you to use visualization as both an exploratory tool (helping *you* understand your data) and a communication tool (helping *others* understand your findings).

## The Grammar of Graphics

Most graphing tools work through point-and-click menus: "Insert → Chart → Bar Chart → Select Data Range." This is intuitive for simple plots but limiting for complex visualizations. You're constrained by whatever the menu offers.

**ggplot2** (the tidyverse visualization package) works differently. It's based on a **grammar of graphics**—a systematic way of describing visualizations by combining components.

**The grammar has three essential components**:

1. **Data**: What dataset are you visualizing?
2. **Aesthetics**: What variables map to visual properties (x-axis, y-axis, color, size)?
3. **Geometries**: What visual marks represent the data (points, bars, lines)?

**Additional components** for refinement:
- **Facets**: Split the plot into subplots by a categorical variable
- **Scales**: Control how data values map to visual values
- **Themes**: Customize non-data elements (fonts, backgrounds, grid lines)

This might sound complicated, but it's actually more flexible and more logical than point-and-click once you understand the pattern.

## Your First ggplot

Let's visualize the distribution of lyric sentiment in our music dataset.

**Load the package and data**:

```r
library(tidyverse)  # Includes ggplot2
library(readr)

music_data <- read_csv("data_clean/final_unified_dataset.csv")
```

**Create a bar chart**:

```r
ggplot(data = music_data, aes(x = Lyric_Sentiment)) +
  geom_bar()
```

**What just happened?**

- `ggplot()`: Initialize a plot with your data
- `aes(x = Lyric_Sentiment)`: Map the Lyric_Sentiment variable to the x-axis
- `geom_bar()`: Draw bars (bar chart geometry)
- `+`: Add layers to the plot (similar to the pipe `%>%` but for plots)

**The result**: A bar chart showing how many songs fall into each sentiment category.

**Anatomy of the code**:

```r
ggplot(data = music_data,           # What data?
       aes(x = Lyric_Sentiment)) +   # What variable on x-axis?
  geom_bar()                         # What visual representation?
```

Every ggplot follows this pattern: **data + aesthetics + geometry**.

## Aesthetics: Mapping Variables to Visuals

**Aesthetics** (`aes()`) specify how variables map to visual properties.

**Common aesthetic mappings**:

- `x`: Position on x-axis
- `y`: Position on y-axis
- `color`: Color of points or lines
- `fill`: Fill color of bars or areas
- `size`: Size of points
- `shape`: Shape of points (circle, triangle, square)
- `alpha`: Transparency (0 = invisible, 1 = opaque)

**Example: Color by sentiment**:

```r
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo, y = Max_Rank, color = Lyric_Sentiment)) +
  geom_point()
```

Now each point's color indicates its sentiment category.

**Example: Size by intensity**:

```r
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo, y = Max_Rank, 
                       color = Lyric_Sentiment, 
                       size = Emotional_Intensity)) +
  geom_point()
```

Point size represents emotional intensity—though be cautious with too many aesthetic mappings, as plots can become cluttered.

## Geometries: Visual Representations

**Geometries** (`geom_*()`) determine how data are displayed visually.

### Bar Charts: Categorical Distributions

**Use when**: Showing counts or proportions of categories

```r
# Count of songs in each sentiment category
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Lyric_Sentiment)) +
  geom_bar()
```

**Horizontal bars** (easier to read labels):

```r
ggplot(music_data, aes(y = Lyric_Sentiment)) +  # y instead of x
  geom_bar()
```

**Bar chart with fill color**:

```r
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Lyric_Sentiment, fill = Lyric_Sentiment)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Positive" = "skyblue", 
                                 "Negative" = "coral", 
                                 "Neutral" = "gray70", 
                                 "Mixed" = "plum"))
```

### Histograms: Continuous Distributions

**Use when**: Showing the distribution of a numeric variable

```r
# Distribution of tempo
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = "steelblue", color = "white")
```

**What's `binwidth`?** It controls how wide each bar is. Smaller binwidth = more detail, but potentially noisy. Larger binwidth = smoother, but may hide patterns.

**Try different binwidths**:

```r
# Too few bins (binwidth = 50)
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 50)

# Too many bins (binwidth = 2)
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2)

# Just right (binwidth = 10)
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10)
```

### Boxplots: Comparing Distributions Across Groups

**Use when**: Comparing a numeric variable across categorical groups

```r
# Tempo distribution by sentiment
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Lyric_Sentiment, y = Tempo)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

**What the boxplot shows**:
- **Box**: Middle 50% of data (25th to 75th percentile)
- **Line inside box**: Median (50th percentile)
- **Whiskers**: Extend to most extreme points within 1.5 × IQR
- **Dots**: Outliers beyond the whiskers

**Add color**:

```r
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Lyric_Sentiment, y = Tempo, fill = Lyric_Sentiment)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

### Scatterplots: Relationships Between Numeric Variables

**Use when**: Exploring correlation between two numeric variables

```r
# Tempo vs. chart position
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo, y = Max_Rank)) +
  geom_point()
```

**Add transparency to see overlapping points**:

```r
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo, y = Max_Rank)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
```

**Color by sentiment**:

```r
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo, y = Max_Rank, color = Lyric_Sentiment)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6)
```

**Add a trend line**:

```r
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo, y = Max_Rank)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)  # Linear regression line
```

`geom_smooth()` adds a smoothed line. `method = "lm"` makes it a straight line (linear model). `se = FALSE` removes the confidence interval shading.

### Line Charts: Trends Over Time

**Use when**: Showing change over time or ordered categories

```r
# Average chart position by year
yearly_avg <- music_data %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(avg_peak = mean(Max_Rank, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(yearly_avg, aes(x = Year, y = avg_peak)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
```

## Faceting: Small Multiples

**Faceting** creates multiple subplots, one for each level of a categorical variable. This is powerful for comparing patterns across groups.

**Facet by one variable** (`facet_wrap()`):

```r
# Tempo distribution by sentiment (separate histogram for each)
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = "steelblue") +
  facet_wrap(~ Lyric_Sentiment)
```

The `~` symbol means "by" or "as a function of." Read it as "facet by Lyric_Sentiment."

**Facet by two variables** (`facet_grid()`):

```r
# Tempo by sentiment AND intensity
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = "coral") +
  facet_grid(Emotional_Intensity ~ Lyric_Sentiment)
```

This creates a grid: rows = Emotional_Intensity, columns = Lyric_Sentiment.

**Control the number of columns in facet_wrap**:

```r
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10) +
  facet_wrap(~ Lyric_Sentiment, ncol = 2)  # Force 2 columns
```

## Customizing Plots for Publication

Default ggplot2 graphs are functional but not polished. Customization makes them publication-ready.

### Adding Labels

```r
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo, y = Max_Rank)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Tempo and Chart Performance in Popular Music",
    subtitle = "Analysis of 200 Billboard Hot 100 songs (2015-2024)",
    x = "Tempo (BPM)",
    y = "Peak Chart Position (lower = better)",
    caption = "Data: Coded lyric sentiment study"
  )
```

### Applying Themes

**Themes** control non-data elements: background, grid lines, fonts, etc.

**Built-in themes**:

```r
# Classic theme (white background, no grid)
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Lyric_Sentiment)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_classic()

# Minimal theme (gray background, white grid)
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Lyric_Sentiment)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_minimal()

# Black and white theme (for print)
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Lyric_Sentiment)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_bw()
```

**Custom theme modifications**:

```r
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Lyric_Sentiment, fill = Lyric_Sentiment)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none",              # Remove legend
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12), # Larger x-axis labels
    axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"), # Bold axis titles
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold")  # Bold title
  )
```

### Adjusting Scales

**Reverse y-axis** (for chart position where lower = better):

```r
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo, y = Max_Rank)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_y_reverse()  # Now top of chart is at the top visually
```

**Change axis limits**:

```r
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo, y = Max_Rank)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlim(60, 180) +  # Tempo from 60 to 180 BPM
  ylim(1, 100)     # Chart positions 1 to 100
```

**Custom color scales**:

```r
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo, y = Max_Rank, color = Lyric_Sentiment)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c("Positive" = "#2E86AB", 
               "Negative" = "#A23B72", 
               "Neutral" = "#F18F01", 
               "Mixed" = "#C73E1D")
  )
```

### Rotating Axis Labels

When category labels are long, rotate them:

```r
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Artist, y = Max_Rank)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

## Combining Multiple Layers

ggplot's real power comes from layering geometries.

**Boxplot with individual points overlaid**:

```r
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Lyric_Sentiment, y = Tempo)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.3, color = "darkblue")  # Jitter prevents overplotting
```

`geom_jitter()` adds small random noise to prevent points from stacking exactly on top of each other.

**Scatterplot with regression line and confidence interval**:

```r
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo, y = Max_Rank)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", fill = "pink")
```

**Multiple trend lines by group**:

```r
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo, y = Max_Rank, color = Lyric_Sentiment)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)  # One line per sentiment
```

## Choosing the Right Visualization

Not all visualizations work for all data types. Here's a guide:

### One Categorical Variable

**Goal**: Show distribution of categories

**Best choice**: Bar chart

```r
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Lyric_Sentiment)) +
  geom_bar()
```

**Avoid**: Pie charts (hard to compare angles)

### One Numeric Variable

**Goal**: Show distribution shape

**Best choice**: Histogram or density plot

```r
# Histogram
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10)

# Density plot (smooth version of histogram)
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo)) +
  geom_density(fill = "skyblue", alpha = 0.5)
```

### Categorical × Numeric

**Goal**: Compare numeric distributions across groups

**Best choice**: Boxplot or violin plot

```r
# Boxplot
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Lyric_Sentiment, y = Tempo)) +
  geom_boxplot()

# Violin plot (shows full distribution shape)
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Lyric_Sentiment, y = Tempo)) +
  geom_violin()
```

### Two Numeric Variables

**Goal**: Explore correlation or relationship

**Best choice**: Scatterplot

```r
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo, y = Max_Rank)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Time Series (Numeric over Time)

**Goal**: Show trends over time

**Best choice**: Line chart

```r
ggplot(yearly_data, aes(x = Year, y = avg_tempo)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
```

### Comparing Many Groups

**Goal**: Show patterns across multiple categorical groups

**Best choice**: Faceted plots

```r
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10) +
  facet_wrap(~ Lyric_Sentiment)
```

## Exporting Visualizations

Once you've created a polished plot, save it for your report or presentation.

**Save the last plot**:

```r
ggsave("figures/tempo_by_sentiment.png", width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 300)
```

- `width` and `height`: Dimensions in inches
- `dpi`: Resolution (300 is publication quality)

**Save a specific plot**:

```r
my_plot <- ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo, y = Max_Rank)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal()

ggsave("figures/tempo_chart_relationship.png", plot = my_plot, 
       width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 300)
```

**File formats**:
- `.png`: Best for web and presentations (supports transparency)
- `.pdf`: Best for print and LaTeX documents (vector graphics, scales perfectly)
- `.jpg`: Smaller file size but lossy compression

## A Complete Visualization Workflow

Here's a realistic workflow from data to polished plot:

```r
library(tidyverse)

# 1. Load cleaned data
music_data <- read_csv("data_clean/final_unified_dataset.csv")

# 2. Explore with a quick plot
ggplot(music_data, aes(x = Tempo, y = Max_Rank, color = Lyric_Sentiment)) +
  geom_point()

# 3. Refine for publication
final_plot <- ggplot(music_data, 
                     aes(x = Tempo, y = Max_Rank, color = Lyric_Sentiment)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, linewidth = 0.8) +
  scale_y_reverse() +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c("Positive" = "#2E86AB", "Negative" = "#A23B72", 
               "Neutral" = "#F18F01", "Mixed" = "#C73E1D"),
    name = "Lyric Sentiment"
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Tempo and Chart Performance by Lyric Sentiment",
    subtitle = "Billboard Hot 100 songs, 2015-2024 (n = 200)",
    x = "Tempo (BPM)",
    y = "Peak Chart Position",
    caption = "Data: Systematic content analysis of coded songs"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, color = "gray30"),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  )

# 4. View
final_plot

# 5. Save
ggsave("figures/tempo_chart_sentiment.png", plot = final_plot, 
       width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)
```

## Practice: Creating Visualizations

### Exercise 13.1: Bar Chart Practice

Create a bar chart showing the distribution of Emotional_Intensity in your dataset. Customize it with:
- Fill colors (Low = green, Medium = yellow, High = red)
- A descriptive title and axis labels
- theme_minimal()

---

### Exercise 13.2: Scatterplot Exploration

Create a scatterplot with Tempo on the x-axis and Max_Rank on the y-axis. Add:
- Points colored by Lyric_Sentiment
- Alpha transparency (0.5)
- A regression line for each sentiment category
- Descriptive labels

What pattern do you notice? Is there a relationship between tempo and chart success?

---

### Exercise 13.3: Faceted Visualization

Create a histogram of Tempo, faceted by Lyric_Sentiment. Use:
- binwidth = 15
- A consistent fill color
- facet_wrap() with 2 columns
- Appropriate labels

How do tempo distributions differ across sentiment categories?

---

### Exercise 13.4: Publication-Ready Plot

Choose one of your visualizations and polish it for publication:
- Add a title, subtitle, and caption
- Apply a clean theme
- Customize colors if using color
- Adjust text sizes for readability
- Export as a .png at 300 dpi

---

## Reflection Questions

1. **Exploration vs. Communication**: Some visualizations are for exploring data yourself (quick and rough). Others are for communicating findings to an audience (polished and clear). How do these goals shape design choices? When is it worth investing time in polish?

2. **Simplicity vs. Information**: You can always add more information to a plot—more colors, more shapes, more facets. But clarity often requires restraint. How do you decide what to include and what to leave out?

3. **Interpretation vs. Misleading**: Every visualization makes choices about scale, aspect ratio, and which data to include. These choices shape interpretation. When does this become misleading? How transparent should you be about visualization decisions?

---

## Chapter Summary

This chapter introduced data visualization with ggplot2:

- **Grammar of graphics**: Visualizations combine data, aesthetics (variable-to-visual mappings), and geometries (visual representations)
- **Core syntax**: `ggplot(data, aes(x, y, color)) + geom_*()`
- **Common geometries**: `geom_bar()` (categorical counts), `geom_histogram()` (numeric distribution), `geom_boxplot()` (compare distributions), `geom_point()` (scatterplots), `geom_line()` (trends)
- **Aesthetics**: Map variables to position (x, y), color, fill, size, shape, alpha (transparency)
- **Faceting**: Create small multiples with `facet_wrap()` or `facet_grid()`
- **Customization**: Add labels (`labs()`), apply themes (`theme_minimal()`), adjust scales (`scale_*()`)
- **Layering**: Combine multiple geometries (boxplot + points, scatterplot + trend line)
- **Choosing visualizations**: Match plot type to data type and research question
- **Exporting**: Use `ggsave()` with appropriate resolution (300 dpi for publication)
- **Workflow**: Explore quickly, refine iteratively, polish for audience

---

## Key Terms

- **Aesthetic mapping**: Connecting data variables to visual properties (color, size, position)

## Looking Ahead

Chapter 14 (The Surprise Detector) introduces statistical inference. You've visualized patterns in your data—now you'll learn to test whether those patterns are statistically significant or could have occurred by chance. This chapter covers chi-square tests for categorical relationships, confidence intervals, p-values, and the logic of null hypothesis testing. You'll learn not just *how* to run statistical tests in R, but *when* to use them and how to interpret results honestly.
