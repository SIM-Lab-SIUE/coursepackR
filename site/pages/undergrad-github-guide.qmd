This guide covers all steps for using GitHub in your group white paper project, including setup, collaboration, and submission.

## Why Use GitHub?

- **Version control:** Save snapshots of your work, track changes
- **Cloud backup:** Protect your team's work
- **Collaboration:** All team members can work on the same project
- **Submission:** Required for your final project

## Steps

### 1. Team Leader: Create a Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/)
2. Create a new **private** repository
3. Name it clearly: e.g., `white-paper-f25`
4. Add a `README.md` file
5. Invite team members as **collaborators**

### 2. All Team Members: Clone the Repository

1. Copy the HTTPS URL from GitHub
2. In RStudio: `File` → `New Project` → `Version Control` → `Git`
3. Paste the URL and choose a local folder
4. Click `Create Project`

### 3. Collaborate Safely

**Create branches** for different sections:
```bash
# In terminal
git checkout -b section-name
```

Examples: `intro`, `methods`, `analysis`, `references`

**Commit regularly:**
- Stage your changes in the Git pane
- Write clear commit messages
- Click `Commit`

**Push your work:**
- Click `Push` in the Git pane
- Your changes appear on GitHub

**Pull before you start working:**
- Click `Pull` to get the latest changes from your teammates
- Prevents conflicts when merging

### 4. Submit Your Project

- Keep all files in your repository
- Final submission: GitHub link (all team members should have access)

## Team Tips

- **Communicate** – Discuss who is working on which section
- **Commit often** – With clear, descriptive messages
- **Pull first, push last** – Always pull before starting and push when done
- **Review before merging** – Use pull requests to review team members' work
- **Keep data files clean** – Use `.gitignore` to exclude temporary files

## Resolving Conflicts

If two team members edit the same section, you may get a merge conflict.

1. Pull the latest changes
2. RStudio will show conflicting lines
3. Choose which version to keep (or combine both)
4. Commit the resolved version
5. Push your changes
