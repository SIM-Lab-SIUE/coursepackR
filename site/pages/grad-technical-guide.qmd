This guide covers technical setup for your APA-formatted research paper and survey design best practices.

## RStudio & Quarto Setup

1. **Create a new RStudio Project** by cloning your GitHub repository
2. **Install necessary R packages:**
   ```r
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "rmarkdown", "quarto", "apaTables", "readr"))
   ```
3. **Download APA 7th Edition CSL file** from [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles)
4. **Save as `apa.csl`** in your project folder
5. **Create your `research_paper.qmd`** file using the template provided

## Survey Design Best Practices

- **Use clear, unbiased questions** – avoid leading or double-barreled questions
- **Pilot test your survey** – ask 3-5 people for feedback before full launch
- **Get instructor approval** – before launching to avoid IRB issues
- **Track response rate** – aim for N=100 minimum
- **Export data as CSV** – after survey closes
- **Document your methodology** – in the Methods section of your paper

## Rendering to PDF

- In RStudio, click the **Render** button or run:
  ```r
  quarto render research_paper.qmd --to pdf
  ```
- PDF will appear in `/output` folder
- Check for formatting errors before submission

## Common Troubleshooting

- **Missing packages:** Run `install.packages("package_name")`
- **Quarto not found:** Run `mccourse_setup()` from the mccoursepack package
- **Citation errors:** Verify `references.bib` and `apa.csl` are in the project root
