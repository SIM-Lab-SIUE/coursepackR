title: "Getting Started"
---

Welcome! Follow these steps once to set up your computer and confirm everything works with **mccoursepack**.

---

## 1) Prerequisites (quick installs)

- **R + RStudio** — already installed.  
  - R: [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)  
  - RStudio Desktop: [Posit downloads](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- **Git** — install Git so you can commit and push work.  
  - Windows: [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)  
  - macOS: [Xcode Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/) or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (`brew install git`)
- **Quarto** — the engine that renders `.qmd` files.  
  - Install: [Quarto Get Started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

> Prefer automation? Step 4’s `mccourse_setup()` can install **Quarto** and **TinyTeX** (LaTeX for PDFs) for you.

---

## 2) Make a course folder + RStudio Project (one time)

1. Create a folder for this course, e.g.:
   - Windows: `Documents\MC451`
   - macOS: `Documents/MC451`
2. In **RStudio**: **File → New Project → New Directory → New Project**, name it **MC451**, and create it in your Documents folder.  
   Working inside a Project keeps paths sane and reproducible.

---

## 3) Install and load the course package

In the **RStudio Console**:

```r
install.packages("pak")                            # one time per machine
pak::pak("SIM-Lab-SIUE/mccoursepack")
library(mccoursepack)                               # load each new R session
packageVersion("mccoursepack")
````

Fallback if `pak` isn’t available:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("SIM-Lab-SIUE/mccoursepack", upgrade = "always", force = TRUE)
library(mccoursepack)
```

---

## 4) One-time setup: Quarto, TinyTeX (PDF), and core R packages

```r
mccourse_setup()   # safe to re-run; only installs what's missing
```

* **Quarto** renders `.qmd` files.
* **TinyTeX** supplies LaTeX for **PDF** output (our templates default to PDF first).
* Installs a small set of core CRAN packages used across materials.

---

## 5) Verify your toolchain

Run these checks:

```r
# Quarto available?
system("quarto --version")

# Git available?
system("git --version")

# TinyTeX installed? (optional check)
if (requireNamespace("tinytex", quietly = TRUE)) tinytex::is_tinytex()
```

If something is missing or errors, run `mccourse_setup()` again and/or restart RStudio.

---

## 6) Explore what the package can do

```r
# What courses are installed?
list_courses()

# What week folders exist for a course?
list_weeks("mc451")  # replace with your course id
```

Copy a week’s scaffold into your Project (this creates `week_XX/` in your current directory):

```r
download_week("mc451", 1, dest = ".")  # example: week 1
```

Open the new `week_XX/` folder in the Files pane, open a `.qmd`, and click **Render**. Templates are configured so **PDF** is the first option; HTML is also available.

> Tip: You can open a week folder from R with `open_week(1, dest = ".")`.

---

## 7) Optional: basic Git/GitHub setup

* In RStudio: **Tools → Global Options → Git/SVN** → ensure Git is detected.
* Sign in to GitHub: [github.com](https://github.com/).
* When you later create a repository for your journal/work, use the **Git** pane (Stage → Commit → Push) to submit updates.

## Quick fixes

* **Quarto not found** → install Quarto or run `mccourse_setup()`, then restart RStudio.
* **PDF render fails** → run `mccourse_setup()` to install TinyTeX.
* **Files didn’t appear** → ensure you’re inside your Project (`getwd()`), then re-run `download_week(...)`.
* **Git push fails** → confirm Git is installed and enabled in RStudio’s Git/SVN settings.
