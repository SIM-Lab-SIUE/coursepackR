title: "Getting Started"
---

Welcome! Follow these steps once to set up your computer and confirm everything works with **mccoursepack**.

---

## 1) Prerequisites (already installed or quick installs)

- **R + RStudio** — you’ve got these.
- **Git** — download & install (Windows: “Git for Windows”; macOS: use Xcode Command Line Tools or Homebrew).  
  - Help: <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>
- **Quarto** — installs the `quarto` command used to render `.qmd`.  
  - Download: <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>

> You can also let `mccourse_setup()` (below) install Quarto and TinyTeX automatically if they’re missing.

---

## 2) Make a course folder + RStudio Project (one time)

1. Create a folder for this course, e.g.:
   - Windows: `Documents\MC451`
   - macOS: `Documents/MC451`
2. In **RStudio**: **File → New Project → New Directory → New Project**, name it **MC451**, and create it in your Documents folder.  
   Projects keep files, working directory, and history together — far fewer path headaches.

---

## 3) Install and load the course package

In the **RStudio Console**:

```r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("SIM-Lab-SIUE/mccoursepack")
library(mccoursepack)   # load it each new R session
packageVersion("mccoursepack")
````

Fallback if `pak` can’t run:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("SIM-Lab-SIUE/mccoursepack", upgrade = "always", force = TRUE)
library(mccoursepack)
```

---

## 4) One-time setup: Quarto, TinyTeX (for PDFs), and core R packages

```r
mccourse_setup()   # answers Yes to prompts if you want this automated
```

* **Quarto** is the engine that renders `.qmd`.
* **TinyTeX** is a small LaTeX distribution used for **PDF** rendering.

You can re-run `mccourse_setup()` any time; it only installs what’s missing.

---

## 5) Verify your toolchain

Run these in the Console:

```r
# Confirm Git is on your PATH
system("git --version")

# RStudio sees version control (GUI)
# Tools -> Global Options -> Git/SVN (no code; just check the box & path)

# Quarto works?
system("quarto --version")  # prints a version if installed

# TinyTeX present?
if (requireNamespace("tinytex", quietly = TRUE)) tinytex::is_tinytex()
```

If any step fails:

* Re-run `mccourse_setup()`.
* See **Troubleshooting** in the sidebar.

---

## 6) Explore what the package can do

```r
# What courses are installed?
list_courses()
# What week folders exist for a course?
list_weeks("mc451")
```

To copy materials into your Project folder (this creates `week_XX/` in your current directory):

```r
download_week("mc451", 1, dest = ".")   # use any available week number
```

Open the new `week_XX/` folder in the Files pane, open a `.qmd`, and click **Render**. Our templates default to **PDF first**; HTML is available too.

---

## 7) Optional: basic Git/GitHub setup

* In RStudio: **Tools → Global Options → Git/SVN**: ensure Git is detected.
* Sign in to GitHub in your browser. When you later create a repository for your journal/work, you’ll use the **Git** pane (Stage → Commit → Push) to submit updates.

---

## Quick fixes

* **Quarto not found** → install Quarto or run `mccourse_setup()`, then restart RStudio.
* **PDF render fails** → run `mccourse_setup()` to install TinyTeX.
* **Files didn’t appear** → ensure you’re inside your Project (check `getwd()`), then re-run `download_week(...)`.
* **Git push fails** → confirm Git is installed and enabled in RStudio’s **Git/SVN** settings.

You’re ready. Keep this page handy; everything else in the sidebar builds on these steps.
