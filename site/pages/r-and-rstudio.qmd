title: "R & RStudio"

## R vs. RStudio

- **R** is the programming language and runtime.  
- **RStudio** (Posit IDE) is the graphical environment where you write code, manage files, and render documents.

---

## The RStudio interface (four panes)

1) **Source** (top-left): edit scripts and `.qmd` files  
2) **Console** (bottom-left): run code interactively  
3) **Environment / History** (top-right): objects, history, etc.  
4) **Files / Plots / Packages / Help / Viewer** (bottom-right)

## Projects: your #1 best practice

Work **inside an RStudio Project** (one folder per class/research project). A Project keeps its own working directory, history, and settings—fewer path problems, more reproducibility. Create one via **File → New Project → New Directory → New Project**.

**Clean-session habit:** set RStudio to **never save/restore `.RData`** (Preferences → General).

---

## Console vs. Script (and Quarto)

- Use the **Console** for quick experiments.  
- Put anything you want to keep into a **script** (`.R`) or **Quarto** document (`.qmd`) and save it. Render `.qmd` with the **Render** button or `quarto render`.

**Handy keys from the Source pane:**  
- Run line/selection: **Ctrl+Enter** (Win/Linux) or **Cmd+Return** (macOS)  
- Insert code chunk in `.qmd`: **Ctrl+Alt+I** (Win/Linux) or **Option+Cmd+I** (macOS)  
- Full list: **Tools → Keyboard Shortcuts Help**

## Files and paths (keep them relative)

Inside a Project, paths are **relative to the project root**—so `data/myfile.csv` works on any machine with the same structure. Avoid `setwd()` in scripts; the Project sets the working directory when you open it.

---

## Git integration

When Git is enabled for your Project, you’ll see a **Git** tab. Use it to **Stage → Commit → Push** your work to GitHub. If you don’t see the tab, enable Git under **Tools → Project Options → Git/SVN** or create the Project from Version Control.

---

## Handy shortcuts

- **Command Palette**: **Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P**  
- **Keyboard Shortcuts Help**: **Alt/Option+Shift+K**  
- **Comment/Uncomment**: **Ctrl+Shift+C** / **Cmd+Shift+C**

---

## Default settings to adopt (once)

- Don’t save/restore `.RData` on exit/start (clean sessions).  
- Keep your course Project in a simple path (e.g., `Documents/MC451`).

## Where this fits with the package

Everything you’ll do with **mccoursepack**—listing weeks, copying materials, rendering `.qmd`—assumes you’re inside a Project. Open the Project, run `library(mccoursepack)`, and you’re set.
