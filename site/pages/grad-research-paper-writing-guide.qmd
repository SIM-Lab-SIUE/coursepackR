This guide provides best practices for writing your APA 7th Edition research paper using Quarto.

## Before You Start

- **Review the assignment requirements:** See [Graduate Research Paper Overview](grad-research-paper-overview.html)
- **Understand APA 7th Edition:** The style guide for academic papers in communication research
- **Set up your environment:** See [Graduate Technical Guide](grad-technical-guide.html)

## Paper Structure (APA 7th Edition)

### 1. Title Page
- Centered title (all caps)
- Author name
- Institutional affiliation
- Author note (if applicable)

In Quarto YAML:
```yaml
title: "Your Full Title Here"
author: "Your Name"
format: pdf
```

### 2. Abstract (150-250 words)

Summarize:
- Research questions/hypotheses
- Method (sample, design)
- Key findings
- Implications

```markdown
## Abstract

[Your 150-250 word summary]
```

### 3. Introduction

Establish:
- Context (why this matters)
- Literature review (what's known)
- Research gap (what's missing)
- Research questions/hypotheses (your contribution)

Target: ~1,500-2,000 words

### 4. Literature Review

Organize by theme, not source list:
- Group related studies
- Compare perspectives
- Identify patterns
- Lead to your research questions

Target: ~2,000-2,500 words

### 5. Methods

Describe your:
- **Research Design:** Quantitative survey (e.g., cross-sectional)
- **Participants:** N=100, demographics, recruitment
- **Procedures:** How you collected data
- **Instruments:** Survey questions, measures
- **Analysis:** Statistical tests used in R

Target: ~800-1,000 words

### 6. Results

Present:
- Demographic tables
- Statistical findings (t-tests, correlations, regressions)
- Data visualizations (APA-formatted figures)
- Organized by research question

Include at least **two APA-formatted visualizations** (tables or figures).

Target: ~500-800 words

### 7. Discussion

Interpret your findings:
- Answer your research questions
- Explain unexpected results
- Compare to prior research
- Acknowledge limitations
- Suggest future research

Target: ~1,000-1,500 words

### 8. References

Automatic in Quarto:
- All sources cited in-text appear here
- Alphabetically sorted
- APA format applied automatically

## APA Style Essentials

### In-Text Citations
```markdown
- One author: (Smith, 2023)
- Two authors: (Smith & Jones, 2023)
- Three+ authors: (Smith et al., 2023)
- Direct quote: (Smith, 2023, p. 45)
```

### Headings
```markdown
# Level 1 Heading
## Level 2 Heading
### Level 3 Heading
```

### Tables & Figures
Include captions:
```markdown
| Measure | Mean | SD |
|---------|------|-----|
| Engagement | 4.2 | 1.1 |

: Table 1. Descriptive Statistics
```

### Writing Style
- **Active voice:** "The study found..." (not "It was found...")
- **Past tense:** "Previous research showed..."
- **Present tense:** "The data suggest..."
- **Avoid:** Contractions, "I," "you," first person

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ No citations in Introduction
- ❌ Copying text from sources (paraphrase & cite!)
- ❌ Inconsistent heading levels
- ❌ Unformatted tables/figures
- ❌ Missing APA references
- ❌ Mixing data from Methods and Results

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with an outline** – organize your thoughts before writing
2. **Write a rough draft first** – don't aim for perfection
3. **Write the Abstract last** – after you know what your paper says
4. **Use Quarto's built-in features** – automatic citations, numbering, formatting
5. **Get feedback** – from peers and your instructor
6. **Proofread carefully** – check for grammar, spelling, APA compliance
