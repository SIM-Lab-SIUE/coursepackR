Your **course journal** is a Quarto **book**. Each **week** has its own **chapter** with **three prompts**—you answer **one**.  
Word ranges are enforced during render:

- **MC 451:** **250–300** words  
- **MC 501:** **450–500** words

---

## What you get after download

Run:

```r
download_journal("mc451", dest = ".")   # or "mc501"
````

This creates:

```
journal/
  _quarto.yml
  index.qmd
  entry_template.qmd
  entries/
  scripts/
    new_journal_entry.R
    update_chapters.R
  prompts_mc451.csv   # or prompts_mc501.csv
  assets/
```

* **`entries/`** holds your week chapters: `week_02.qmd`, `week_03.qmd`, …
* **`scripts/new_journal_entry.R`** creates a week chapter, injects the **three prompts for that week**, sets word-range based on your course, and updates `_quarto.yml`.
* **`_quarto.yml`** is the book’s table of contents. Do **not** edit the `# BEGIN AUTO … # END AUTO` block—scripts manage it.

> Prompts are stored in a CSV **by week** (no randomness). Exactly **three** prompts per week must be present.

## Add a week chapter

From inside the `journal/` folder:

```r
source("scripts/new_journal_entry.R")
```

You’ll be prompted for a **week number** (e.g., 2–14). The script will:

1. Create `entries/week_XX.qmd` from `entry_template.qmd`.
2. Inject the **three prompts for that week**.
3. Set the correct **word range** for your course (MC 451 or MC 501).
4. Update `journal/_quarto.yml`.

Open the new file and write your **single** response in the **Response** section.

---

## Write the entry

Open `entries/week_XX.qmd` and scroll to **Response**.
Answer **one** prompt. Keep it within your range:

* MC 451: 250–300 words
* MC 501: 450–500 words

The word counter appears when you render. It counts text **only** inside the Response block—don’t add extra sections outside it.

---

## Render the journal (book)

From inside `journal/`:

```bash
quarto render
```

Outputs are written to `journal/_book/`:

* HTML book (always)
* PDF/EPUB if enabled and TinyTeX is installed

If PDF fails:

```bash
quarto install tinytex
```

(or run `mccourse_setup()` in R).

---

## Submit & version your work

When you add a chapter, **two files change**:

1. `journal/entries/week_XX.qmd`
2. `journal/_quarto.yml`

Use the **Git** pane (or command line) to **Stage → Commit → Push** **both** files.
If `_quarto.yml` isn’t committed, the new chapter won’t appear on other machines.

## Prompts CSV (for maintainers)

Prompts live in `prompts_mc451.csv` or `prompts_mc501.csv` (same folder as `scripts/`).

**Required columns (no category column):**

```csv
week,prompt_id,prompt
2,1,"Prompt text A for Week 2"
2,2,"Prompt text B for Week 2"
2,3,"Prompt text C for Week 2"
3,1,"Prompt text A for Week 3"
3,2,"Prompt text B for Week 3"
3,3,"Prompt text C for Week 3"
```

* Provide **exactly three** rows per week (`prompt_id` usually 1,2,3).
* The script **fails loudly** if a week does not have exactly three prompts.

## FAQ (journal-specific)

**Where do prompts come from?**
From the course CSV (`prompts_mc451.csv` or `prompts_mc501.csv`) with **three prompts per week**.

**My word count says “Out of range.”**
Trim/extend your Response to fit your course range (MC 451: 250–300; MC 501: 450–500).

**The new week chapter doesn’t show in the book.**
Commit and push **both** `entries/week_XX.qmd` **and** `_quarto.yml`, then re‑render.

**Can I revise a chapter later?**
Yes—edit `entries/week_XX.qmd` and commit the changes. No need to rerun the script for the same week.

## Summary

* Journal = **Quarto book** under `journal/`
* Each week = **one chapter** with **three prompts** → answer **one**
* Word ranges enforced per course
* Always **commit both** the new chapter and `_quarto.yml`
