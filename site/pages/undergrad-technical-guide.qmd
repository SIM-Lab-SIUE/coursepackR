This guide covers technical setup for your Quarto white paper and survey design best practices for your team project.

## RStudio & Quarto Setup

1. **One team member creates the RStudio Project** by cloning your GitHub repository
2. **All team members:** Clone the same repository to your computers
3. **Install necessary R packages:**
   ```r
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "rmarkdown", "quarto", "readr"))
   ```
4. **Create your `white_paper.qmd`** file using the template provided
5. **Organize your `/data` folder** with:
   - `survey_data_raw.csv` (original export)
   - `survey_data_clean.csv` (after cleaning)

## Survey Design Best Practices

- **Use clear, unbiased questions** – avoid leading or double-barreled questions
- **Pilot test your survey** – ask 3-5 people for feedback before full launch
- **Get instructor approval** – before launching
- **Track response rate** – aim for N=100+ responses
- **Export data as CSV** – from your survey platform (Qualtrics, Google Forms, etc.)
- **Name your file clearly** – `survey_data_raw.csv`

## Rendering to PDF

- In RStudio, click the **Render** button or run:
  ```r
  quarto render white_paper.qmd --to pdf
  ```
- PDF will appear in `/output` folder
- Each team member should verify formatting before final submission

## Team Collaboration on GitHub

- **Create branches** for different sections (e.g., `intro`, `methods`, `analysis`)
- **Commit regularly** with clear messages
- **Pull before pushing** to avoid conflicts
- **Communicate** about who is working on which section
