Welcome to **mccoursepack**. This guide helps you install tools, open your first project, and render your first journal.

# Quick Setup

Follow these steps to get your system ready with the **latest course package** and two dedicated RStudio projects--one for your **weekly class tasks** and one for your **weekly journal**.

---

## Step 1 -- Install or Update the Course Package

The course package `mccoursepack` is hosted on GitHub. Use the `remotes` package to install or update it.

```r
# Install remotes if not already installed
install.packages("remotes")

# Install or update the course package
remotes::install_github("SIM-Lab-SIUE/mccoursepack")

# Load the package
library(mccoursepack)
````

::: tip
Run the `remotes::install_github()` command at the start of the semester and again whenever updates are announced.

## Step 2 -- Create Two RStudio Projects

Projects keep everything organized. You'll create **two**:

1. A **Tasks Project** for weekly assignments.
2. A **Journal Project** for your course journal.

### Create the Tasks Project

1. In RStudio: **File -> New Project -> New Directory -> New Project**.
2. Choose a location, e.g., `Documents/MC451/`.
3. Name the folder: `tasks_project`.
4. Click **Create Project**.

### Create the Journal Project

1. Again: **File -> New Project -> New Directory -> New Project**.
2. Same parent folder (`Documents/MC451/`).
3. Name the folder: `journal_project`.
4. Click **Create Project**.

You now have two separate projects: one for all weekly tasks, one for your running journal.

---

## Step 3 -- Set Up the Journal Project

1. Open the **journal\_project** in RStudio.
2. In the Console, run:

```r
download_journal("mc451")   # or "mc501" if in the graduate course
```

This creates the `journal/` folder structure with an `entries/` directory, a template, and scripts for adding new entries.

---

## Step 4 -- Set Up the Tasks Project

1. Open the **tasks\_project** in RStudio.
2. Use the helper function to download the starter files for your first week:

```r
download_week("mc451", week = 1)
```

(or substitute `"mc501"` for the graduate course).

Repeat each week: change the `week` number to get that week's scaffold.

---

## Step 5 -- Confirm Everything Works

* Open the **journal_project** -> render the index file:

  ```bash
  quarto render
  ```

  This should build a unified journal book.

* Open the **tasks_project** -> render a week's scaffold.
  Check that Quarto builds the `.qmd` file into HTML/PDF.

If both projects render without errors, you're fully set up.

---

## Mental Model

* **Journal project**: long-running notebook, one entry per week.
* **Tasks project**: fresh scaffolds each week for assignments, labs, and exercises.
* **mccoursepack package**: the engine that fetches and organizes everything for you.
