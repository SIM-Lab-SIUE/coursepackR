Common problems and fixes.

This page collects quick fixes and diagnostic commands for the tools used in this course.

---

## Quarto isn’t found / Render button doesn’t work

**Fix:**
1. Install Quarto: <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>  
2. Restart RStudio  
3. Verify in a terminal:

```bash
quarto check
quarto --version
````

---

## PDF render fails (“No TeX installation detected”, missing LaTeX package)

**Fix (fastest):**

```bash
quarto install tinytex
```

Verify from R:

```r
if (requireNamespace("tinytex", quietly = TRUE)) tinytex::is_tinytex()
```

---

## Quarto tries to render the whole repo

Whitelist only the intended files in `site/_quarto.yml`:

```yaml
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: _site
  render:
    - index.qmd
    - pages/**/*.qmd
```

---

## “Files didn’t appear” after running package commands

1. Confirm you are inside your course **Project**:

   ```r
   getwd()
   ```

2. Refresh the **Files** pane in RStudio.

3. Check the expected folder manually.

4. Re-run the command and review any error messages.

---

## RStudio doesn’t show the Git tab

Enable Git for the Project:
**Tools → Project Options → Git/SVN** (or create the Project from Version Control).

Verify Git is installed and on your PATH:

```bash
git --version
```

---

## Git push fails (password prompts, auth errors)

Use **HTTPS + Personal Access Token (PAT)** or **SSH**.

* **PAT (recommended)**
  Create a PAT and paste it when Git asks for a password. Install Git Credential Manager to cache it.

  * Token docs: [https://docs.github.com/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token](https://docs.github.com/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
  * Git Credential Manager: [https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager)

* **SSH (alternative)**
  Add your public key in **GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys**.
  Docs: [https://docs.github.com/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh](https://docs.github.com/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

---

## Website didn’t update on GitHub Pages

* **Using GitHub Actions (recommended)**

  * Check **Actions → Quarto Pages**: it should render, upload the artifact, and deploy.
  * Repo **Settings → Pages**: set **Source = GitHub Actions**.

* **Using branch deployment (`/docs`)**

  * Render locally to `docs/` and commit.
  * Repo **Settings → Pages**: set **Source = main /docs**.

system("quarto --version")
system("git --version")
if (requireNamespace("tinytex", quietly = TRUE)) tinytex::is_tinytex()
