This page documents the functions students actually use.  
All commands assume you are working inside an RStudio **Project**.

## At a glance

| Function | What it does |
|----------|--------------|
| `list_courses()` | Lists installed course IDs (e.g., `"mc451"`, `"mc501"`). |
| `list_weeks(course = NULL)` | Lists available week folders (e.g., `"week_01"`) for a course. If `NULL`, aggregates across all installed courses. |
| `download_week(course, week, dest = ".")` | Creates **`week_XX/`** under `dest` and copies that week’s files there. |
| `open_week(week, dest = ".")` | Opens the local `week_XX/` folder in your system’s file browser. |
| `mccourse_setup(ask = TRUE, pkgs = c(...))` | One-time helper: installs Quarto, TinyTeX (for PDF), and core CRAN packages if missing. |
| `mccourse_self_test()` | Prints the courses and weeks the package can see (sanity check). |
| `mccourse_update()` | Updates **mccoursepack** to the latest GitHub build. |

## `list_courses()`

```r
list_courses()
````

Returns a character vector of course IDs (e.g., `"mc451"`, `"mc501"`).
If no courses are installed, returns an empty vector.

---

## `list_weeks(course = NULL)`

```r
list_weeks()         # across all installed courses
list_weeks("mc451")  # for a specific course
```

Returns folder names like `"week_01"`, `"week_02"`, …
Empty if no weeks are installed for that course.

---

## `download_week(course, week, dest = ".")`

```r
download_week("mc451", 1, dest = ".")   # accepts 1, "01", or "week_01"
```

* Creates `dest/week_01/` (or another `week_XX/`)
* Copies that week’s files **into** the folder
* Preserves subfolders
* Empty templates (e.g., holidays) still create the folder but copy no files

Returns (invisibly) a list:

```r
list(dest, course, week, n_copied)
```

---

## `open_week(week, dest = ".")`

```r
open_week(1, dest = ".")
```

Opens `dest/week_01/` in your system file browser.

---

## `mccourse_setup(ask = TRUE, pkgs = c(...))`

```r
mccourse_setup()   # safe to re-run; installs only what’s missing
```

Ensures that:

* **Quarto** is installed (for rendering `.qmd`)
* **TinyTeX** (LaTeX) is available for **PDF** output
* A small set of **core CRAN packages** are installed

---

## `mccourse_self_test()`

```r
mccourse_self_test()
```

Runs a basic sanity check: prints which courses are installed and which weeks are available.

---

## `mccourse_update()`

```r
mccourse_update()
```

Updates **mccoursepack** to the latest GitHub version.
(Equivalent to running `pak::pak("SIM-Lab-SIUE/mccoursepack")` manually.)

---

## Common patterns

* Always open your **RStudio Project** before using package commands.
* Render `.qmd` files to **PDF** (default) or **HTML** with Quarto.
* If PDF rendering fails, run:

```r
mccourse_setup()
```

to install TinyTeX and other dependencies.
