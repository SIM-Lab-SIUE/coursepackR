Welcome! Follow these steps **once** to prepare your computer and confirm everything works with **mccoursepack**.  
After this, your weekly rhythm lives on the [Workflows](workflows.qmd) page.

---

## 1) Install prerequisites

- **R + RStudio**
  - R: <https://cran.r-project.org/>
  - RStudio Desktop: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>
- **Git** (to commit/push from RStudio)
  - Windows: <https://gitforwindows.org/>
  - macOS: install Xcode Command Line Tools or use Homebrew →  
    ```bash
    brew install git
    ```
- **Quarto** (renders `.qmd` files): <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>
- **Windows only: Rtools** (required to build packages from GitHub source)
  - Download: <https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/>
  - Install the version that matches your R (e.g., R 4.5 → Rtools 4.5).
  - Restart RStudio after installing.
  - Verify in R:
    ```r
    pkgbuild::check_build_tools(debug = TRUE)
    ```
    If it prints `TRUE`, you’re ready.

> Prefer automation? Step 4’s `mccourse_setup()` can install **Quarto** and **TinyTeX** automatically.  
> Rtools must still be installed manually on Windows.

## 2) Create your course folder + RStudio Project

1. Make a folder, e.g.  
   - Windows: `Documents\MC451` or `Documents\MC501`  
   - macOS: `Documents/MC451` or `Documents/MC501`
2. In **RStudio**:  
   **File → New Project → New Directory → New Project**  
   Name it `MC451` (or `MC501`) and place it in Documents.

Projects keep paths stable and reproducible.

---

## 3) Install and load the course package

In the **RStudio Console**:

```r
install.packages("pak")                              # once per machine
pak::pak("SIM-Lab-SIUE/mccoursepack")
library(mccoursepack)                                # load each session
packageVersion("mccoursepack")
````

Fallback if `pak` isn’t available:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("SIM-Lab-SIUE/mccoursepack", upgrade = "always", force = TRUE)
library(mccoursepack)
```

---

## 4) Run the one-time setup helper

```r
mccourse_setup()   # safe to re-run; installs only what’s missing
```

This ensures:

* **Quarto** is installed (engine for `.qmd`)
* **TinyTeX** is installed (LaTeX for PDF)
* Core CRAN packages are available

---

## 5) Verify the toolchain

```r
system("quarto --version")     # Quarto?
system("git --version")        # Git?
if (requireNamespace("tinytex", quietly = TRUE)) tinytex::is_tinytex()  # TinyTeX?
```

If anything is missing, re-run `mccourse_setup()` and restart RStudio.

---

## 6) Pull your first week scaffold (sanity check)

```r
list_courses()                          # installed courses
list_weeks("mc451")                     # week folders
download_week("mc451", week = 1, dest = ".")
```

Open `week_01/`, edit the `.qmd`, and click **Render** (PDF or HTML).
This confirms the package + Quarto toolchain work.

---

## 7) Pull the Journal (Quarto book)

```r
download_journal("mc451", dest = ".")   # or "mc501"
```

This creates a `journal/` folder with:

```
journal/
  _quarto.yml
  index.qmd
  entry_template.qmd
  entries/
  scripts/
  prompts_mc451.csv
  assets/
```

* **MC 451 entries:** 250–300 words
* **MC 501 entries:** 450–500 words
* Each chapter shows 3 prompts → **answer exactly one**
* Word counter (when rendered) checks your range

---

## 8) Add your first journal entry

From inside `journal/`:

```r
source("scripts/new_journal_entry.R")
```

This creates `entries/YYYY-MM-DD.qmd`, inserts prompts, sets the word-count range, and updates `_quarto.yml`.
Open it, write your response, and render.

---

## 9) Render outputs

* **Week files:** open `.qmd` inside `week_XX/` → **Render**
* **Journal book:** open `journal/` → **Render**, or run:

```bash
quarto render
```

Output is written to `journal/_book/`.

---

## 10) Optional: connect Git/GitHub

* In RStudio: **Tools → Global Options → Git/SVN** → check Git detection
* Sign in at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
* Use the **Git** pane: Stage → Commit → Push

> Journal note: when you add a chapter, commit **both** the new file and `journal/_quarto.yml`.

---

## Quick fixes

* **Quarto not found** → install Quarto or run `mccourse_setup()`, then restart
* **PDF render fails** → `mccourse_setup()` to install TinyTeX
* **Files missing** → confirm you’re inside the Project (`getwd()`), re-run `download_week()`/`download_journal()`
* **New journal entry not listed** → commit the updated `_quarto.yml` and re-render
* **Word count out of range** → check MC 451 (250–300) vs MC 501 (450–500); only the **Response** is counted
* **Windows build error (“Could not find tools necessary to compile a package”)** → install [Rtools](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/) and restart
