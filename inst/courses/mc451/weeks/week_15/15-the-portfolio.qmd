## Overview

Your research is only as impactful as your ability to communicate it. This week focuses on assembling your semester's work into a professional research portfolio — a Quarto-based website that showcases your project from question to conclusion.

**Reading:** Chapter 16 — The Portfolio

## Key Concepts

- Research communication as a core competency
- The Quarto website as a publication platform
- Portfolio structure: narrative arc from question to conclusion
- Visual design for academic communication
- Reproducibility in the final product
- Audience awareness: writing for non-specialists

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

1. Structure a research portfolio with a clear narrative arc
2. Create a multi-page Quarto website
3. Integrate code, visualizations, and written analysis
4. Design for clarity and professional presentation
5. Prepare materials for the final portfolio submission

## Assignment: Inferencing Data in R (25 pts)

### Part 1: Portfolio Scaffold (10 pts)

Using the `final_project()` function from coursepackR, create your portfolio structure:

```r
library(coursepackR)
final_project()
```

This creates a Quarto website project with:
- `index.qmd` — Home/introduction page
- `method.qmd` — Your methodology
- `results.qmd` — Findings and visualizations
- `discussion.qmd` — Interpretation and limitations
- `references.bib` — Your bibliography

### Part 2: Content Integration (10 pts)

Begin populating your portfolio pages with content from your semester's work:

1. **Introduction:** Your research question, theoretical framework, and significance
2. **Method:** Your codebook, sampling strategy, and data collection process
3. **Results:** Your descriptive and inferential analyses with visualizations
4. **Discussion:** Your interpretation, limitations, and future directions

### Part 3: Design & Rendering (5 pts)

- Choose a Quarto theme that suits your project
- Ensure all visualizations render correctly
- Check that the site navigation works
- Render the site locally and verify all pages

## Discussion Questions

1. Why is a web-based portfolio more effective than a traditional paper for research communication?
2. How do you adapt your writing when your audience includes both specialists and general readers?
3. What role does visual design play in making research accessible?

## Submission Checklist

- [ ] Portfolio structure created using `final_project()`
- [ ] At least 2 pages populated with content
- [ ] Site renders locally without errors
- [ ] Progress documented and uploaded to Blackboard
