This guide covers all steps for using GitHub in your research project, including setup, version control, and submission.

## Why Use GitHub?

- **Version control:** Save snapshots, roll back changes
- **Cloud backup:** Protect your work
- **Portability:** Work from any computer
- **Submission:** Required for your final project

## Steps

### 1. Create a Private Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/)
2. Create a new **private** repository
3. Name it clearly: e.g., `grad-research-paper-f25`
4. Add a `README.md` file

### 2. Clone to RStudio

1. Copy the HTTPS URL from GitHub
2. In RStudio: `File` → `New Project` → `Version Control` → `Git`
3. Paste the URL and choose a local folder
4. Click `Create Project`

### 3. Work Locally

- Edit files in RStudio
- Commit changes regularly:
  - `Git` pane → Check files to stage
  - Write a clear commit message
  - Click `Commit`

### 4. Push to GitHub

- Click `Push` in the Git pane
- Your changes now appear on GitHub

### 5. Submit Your Project

- Keep all files in your repository
- Final submission: GitHub link to Blackboard

## Tips

- **Commit often** – with clear, descriptive messages
- **Pull before pushing** – to avoid conflicts
- **Keep sensitive data out** – never commit API keys or personal info
- **Use .gitignore** – to exclude files like `.Rhistory` or `data/`
